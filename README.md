## Datasets
🌹🌹 We have supplemented the REDIAL and INSPIRED datasets with additional multimodal data. If you use the multimodal conversational recommendation dataset, please cite our paper~ ❤️

The processed dataset can be found here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M2cIDFD_a-o1HCgGmN8pEeGgT21xo5oe?usp=drive_link)

We have released the visual information obtained through web crawling. (The following image shows the posters and stills acquired by web crawling using item information from the INSPIRED dataset.)

Hi I am looking for a movie recommendation. Well, you've come to the right person. When you have a GF, you tend to see a lot of movies.. I am married and have two kids ages 2 and 4 so of course I was wondering what would be suitable out there for them. Do you have a particular genre in mind? Horror, comedy, etc.... It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g. Well, the obvious choice is A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It's about Mr. Rogers.. Do we know how long that movie is. Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot.. That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated?. For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie. Oh nice. What is that one about?. It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too.. That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one. You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best.. I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids. ", ". Hi! What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. I like to watch romantic comedies.. Oh thats great, I do too! Have you seen To All The Boys I've Loved Before?. No, I don't think I have seen this movie before. Can you tell me a little bit about it? Maybe who is in it and the plot.. The plot is basically a girls love letters shes written to her past loves are exposed. It sort of came out of nowhere and the sequel is coming out soon!. Oh okay, sounds like a very interesting plot. I accept your recommendation.. Well the sequel looks great so I think you will also like the original!. Thanks for that recommendation, I will definitely check it out! Do you have any other recommendations?. Yes! A new movie called The Lovebirds! In this a couple basically are accidentally involved in a murder and are trying to solve it to clear their name.. Wow, what a plot twist! That one sounds very interesting as well. Do you know who stars in this movie?. Yes that has Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae!. Okay, I am not very familiar with those two actors. So, I may have to reject this recommendation.. Gotcha, theres also a movie called The Prom, it has Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden, Ariana DeBose, Kerry Washington, Andrew Rannells, and Awkwafina!. What is the plot of this movie?. Well actually maybe thats not great, its more of a musical, how about The Office Mixup? A woman pretends to be a corporate executive after a case of mistaken identity at her workplace.. No, I think I will have to reject that recommendation.. Ok,there is a movie called Isn't It Romantic with Rebel Wilson, Natalie is a New York architect who works hard to get noticed at her job, but is more likely to deliver coffee and bagels than design the city's next skyscraper.

What types of movies do you like?. i really like action/adventure movies, and i enjoy a good horror film too. do you have any suggestions?. I did just watch a horror movie called Midsommar with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd. You heard of it?. i have, and i've seen it too! i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time. i appreciate the cinematography though. since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations?. Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha. Anyways, other ones I liked recently were Joker (though most people have seen that haha), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Oldie but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be Blood (super weird and quite good). ohh, you know what, i haven't seen Joker yet but i've really been wanting to! i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently? No Country for Old Men is one i've been meaning to watch as well, thank you for the reminder, haha!. Oh nice! Yeah, I was late to the Joker train but it's fascinating movie. I know that a lot of hype can bring people into movies with inflated expectations but I went in knowing as little as possible and it really was great. Awesome atmosphere and great acting.. i try not to let the hype affect my expectations too much, but sometimes i can't help but hold a movie to a higher standard after a certain point. well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance!. Nice :). Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects. oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie.. Well they both have unusually great acting so that'll definitely be a plus for you. Joker's massively pushed forward by Phoenix's great acting.. fantastic, that's really reassuring to hear! the last film i saw with Phoenix in it was Signs, and he was awesome in that as well.. I'm not sure I've actually seen anything else he was in that I recognized at least haha. But I was thinking of looking up some other ones to see after this movie, though I got distracted and never followed through with that. Maybe now I'll remember :P. oh, really? Signs is a great place to start.:). ", ". Hi! Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in?. I normally love comedies.. Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?. I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though.. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?. That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres?. ", ". Hey, how ya doin?:). Good thanks, and you.. im pretty good, so what was the last movie you saw?:). Watched Passanger last night. dope! what did you like about it?. I liked it space travel is cool. I really like space too! do you watch a lot of movies focusing around space travel?. Yes its always been a thing for me, starting back in the day lile startrack. Nice, nice! I have a couple movies in mind but i still need to narrow down your interests, would you want a movie that messes with your mind?. Sure thats what being in space is all about. Have you seen arrival?. Yes both of them. and I liked em both.. I liked them too, how about 2001: a space odyssey?. Yes saw it also could would watch it again.. I'll try to find you something you haven't seen though c:. cool thanks. how about a man from earth?. Seen it around but have not watch it.. Its about a professor's farewell party that turns into an interrogation after he reveals his past is much longer, and stranger, than he led them to believe. Cool sounds good.. Is that something you'd like then?. Yes I think I will give it a try thank-you. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Heh, maybe I'll check that out too.

Dear Sir/Mam I'm here to recommend a movie trailer to you. How are you today?. I'm great thank you for asking!. Do you know what kind of movies you like?.

Hmm, let me think unpredictable action comedy.... I also saw Snowpiercer the day before and liked it a lot - more than Parasite.. Yea, Snowpiercer had some real speed to it. Though both it and Parasite had very pretty cinematography. Do you prefer that prettier more artistic style to a blockbuster action like the new Mission Impossible?. It depends on how I'm feeling in the moment but I usually go for more light hearted films that are easy to digest.. Ahh for a moment I was thinking maybe you'd be interested in another Bong Joon-ho film. The Host is more action packed a 'la Snowpiercer but it does have some white-knuckled horror moments.. I would be interested! What is The Host about?. When toxic waste and American hegemony collide nature(?) produces a monster that puts innocent people at risk. Working together a family must .... That makes me want to learn more about it. I'll definitely look more into it and watch the trailers, etc. I accept your recommendation :).. Great! I hope you enjoy it. Nice chatting.. Are there any actors I would recognize in The Host?. Kang-ho Song the father from Parasite also in Snowpiercer is in the movie.. That's great! I love his acting. You mentioned that it has bits of horror but should I be expecting any jump scares?. Yes there are a couple of those to start things off with some anxiety.. How graphic does the movie get? My partner doesn't like really gory scenes so would it be a movie to avoid watching with him?. ", ". Hi how are you doing?. fine.you?. ", ". Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer.. Hi!

Carroll Shelby and British car driver Ken Miles are fighting the big wigs at Ford trying to convince them that they could build a race car to beat Ferrari.. Sounds cool, i watched a documentary on the event awhile back. Are the lead actors good? This might be something im interested in.. Matt Damon and Christain Bale. Both awesome actors. Well worth watching. I highly recommend it.. What others movie would you recommend?. I loved the Martian with Matt Damon. It's older but definitely worth watching.. Oh yeah, it was very good. I have the book on my desk, currently rereading it. The movie is very powerful.. Excellent!! I could watch that one a million times. I've not read the book. I will check it out.. I think i might check it out again. I accept that recommendation.. I think I will have to watch it again also.. What other Matt damon movies do you recommend? I think hes a very good actor..

The Informant and Promised Land. Both are excellent. Both based on true stories.. whats the informant about?. It's about a guy that work for an agriculture corp Archer Daniels Midland. He is a bit of an espionage nut so he finds out they are involved in a price fixing conspiracy and he informs the FBI. And then they get him to wear a wire. It's really good and a bit funny also.. And what about Promised Land? I dont think im feeling The Informant.. Matt Damon again of course. He's a salesman for a natural gas company and he's trying to secure the drilling rights for the natural gas company. The town is desperate so they will accept anything. There is a school teacher (Hal Holbrook) and he's trying to stop the company. Matt Damon is torn. It's good.. Oh that sounds good. Now im torn between We Bought a Zoo and Promised Land.

No, I haven't see that movie. What is it about? Who play in that movie? I love all kind of movies but more interested in a romance at the moment.. the first one is actually called To all the boys I've loved before and the second is called To all the boys p.s. I still love you. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes. Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy! The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time. She has to choose one of them though, who will it be?. OH WOW! I know she was like OMG. I am curious on how the letters got out. I glad that never happened to me. I am also curious on who will it be as well.. You should watch the movie so you can find out. It stars a handful of Netflix's new age of top actors and actresses like Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, and Janel Parrish.. Okay awesome I will watch it thank you.

The last horror film I saw and liked was A Quiet Place. Such a unique film that relied on silence!. I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different?. A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!. I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.. Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dread in horror.

Great, what kind of movies would you recommend?. What type of movies do you tend to like?. I don't have a genre I like specifically. I just prefer movies that are critically acclaimed.. OK, what was the last movie you watched?. I just watched Booksmart.. Did you like it?. Yes, it was good. What did you like most about it?. It was really well written and the cast was really good.. Have you seen Lady Bird?. I have. It was very good. It is something I would watch again. Thanks for the recommendation.. Do you prefer the humor or the deeper story?. I don't really have a preference. I like both.. Have you seen the movie Dope? It's got a similar theme of a teen coming of age, except in this case he lives in a tough neighborhood and gets caught up in an adventure.. No. I have never heard of that movie. Do you know who is in it?. ", ". Hello. Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me?. Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc.... I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama.. Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.. It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining.. I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it.. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL. I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!.

I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that. Well I recently watched Call me by Your Name, and it was beautiful; both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning.

I have actually seen that one and I thought it was a little boring because it was more about killing time with his daughter. My favorite movie of all time is Jack Reacher. what about the new The Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford ? thats a great movie !. I think that looks interesting! Ill accept that recommendation!. Great ! The story follows Buck, a domestic dog who finds himself in the wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the late 1800s. Based on the 1903 Jack London book of the same name, the movie stars Harrison Ford as Bucks owner, John Thornton.. Sounds cool!!. Can you watch the trailer ? Let me know your thoughts ?. it looks really cool! I really want to see it. The CGI of the dog looks a little fake but otherwise the movie seems to have really cool scenary. I watched it with my best friend, and we kept talking how we relate to the friendship of the main character and the dog .. Yeah and I just recently got a dog so it will be a great movie to see. Plus Harrison is such a great actor. he really is! Such an epic voice. well you said you like action pics , so you can't get more action than this !. Exactly I am really excited to see it!.

Its hilarious. it features Mila Kunis, kristen Bell,Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate... Those are A-quality movie stars. Thank you! Would you also have a recommendation on drama?

Its a movie about dogs and their loyalty to their owners. That sounds like a good movie. Thank you!. What else do you enjoy.

I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama.. Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.. It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining.. I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it.. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL. I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!. No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split.. I just watched Split recently! I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.. That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for Unbreakable. Honestly, I'm glad Split came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now.. That's so true. I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days. But sometimes, I think movies like Star Wars rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan..

It's an excellent movie that has elements of both action and adventure. Plus, there are many great actors that add a lot of comedy to it. I am a big fan of Duane The Rock Johnson, Jack Black and Danny DeVito. They all did an amazing job!. Right. The Rock, Jack Black and Danny DeVito are hilarious actors. I also really enjoy a good myster or thriller with a complicated plot!. I agree. Mystery/Thriller movies are among the best and I too enjoy a good mystery/thriller. Have you heard of the movie Murder on the Orient Express? It has an amazing script and story that kept me guessing until the end!. yes, I saw it that film many years ago. I really enjoyed the thrilling twisted plot. You're right it kept me guessing right til the end.. /Indeed, I agree. I forgot to ask, have you seen the first installment of the new Jumaji? Is there another movie trailer you would like to discuss for possible viewing. I have not seen the first installment of the new Jumanji. I loved the original with Robin Williams. I saw a trailer for Avator recently. A sci-fi fantasy genre that looked very interesting and beautiful special effects.. I remember you saying that The Rock, Jack Black are hilarious actors. They did a great job in both movies. The new Jumaji took the original story in a different direction from the original film, which is something I enjoyed and respect immensely. Would you like to see this trailer? Otherwise, we can discuss the incredible film Avator, which was directed by James Cameron. as you may know, he is a very accomplished director.. I think that would be a terrific idea to watch the Jumaji trailer, yes. Looking forward to that!. Great! I think it is something you will enjoy based on our conversation. I hope you have a wonderful day! Enjoy the trailer.. You as well enjoy the day!. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["It is the movie that I consider to be closest to Billy Madison.

So, what type of movie have you been wanting to see lately?. I like horror movies, action or thriller types. Have you seen the new IT movie yet?. I did, it was very scary, i had to hide during the parts with the clown lol. Yes, pennywise was highly scary in that movie. What did you think of it?. I think they did a good job on the remake. I didn't appreciate the Pet Semetary remake quite as much.. I haven't seen the pet cemetary remake yet. Was it scary?. It was scary but you can't think of it as the same movie like the book, it's a completely different story. Well books are usually better than the movies lol. So, if you had to decide which movie was better, as far as scare tactic goes? IT or pet cemetary?. I think IT was far more scary and better overall. I couldn't agree more!. Have you seen anything recent that was good? I haven't been to the theater since Cap Marvel. Not lately no. The last movie I saw was john wick 3. I hear the john wick movies are good. Yes they definitely are!. You can recommend those :P lol. ", ". Hello. hello. What kind of movies do you like?. horror, love, fantasy. Hmmm- Do you often go to the movies. yes, I love going to the movies when they first come out. Ok So you enjoy opening night. yes but there are some times that its good to go on the last night that they are in the theater. What was the last movie you saw. impractical jokers. Have you seen Zombieland?. yes I think it is a great movie, it is very comical. I Love woody Harrelson-. Emma Stone is a really good actress, I love how her and her sister keep stealing the boys car. Yes- Unfortunatly we are all stuck home because of Covid 19. I agree but it gives people time to watch movies or netflix, there are some really good movies on netflix and I have all the Harry Potter movies. I love watching them. Yes- Netflix- I can get caught up on some films i have missed. There are some good films but also series that are really good, I am watching The Office right now but have watched a number of really good movies and series on Netflix. I loved the show Once Upon a Time it brings back all the disney characters that you knew when you were a kid and is really good.. I loved the book and I really want to see when I can Call of the Wild. never seen it but would love to watch it, I like watching new things. I have been trying to watch everything I have watched many random movies and some that you think would suck turned out to be really good movies.. The movie is based on a novel by Jack London- sometimes the novel does not translate well in the movie- Harrison Ford is a great actor- looking forward to it. my fiance said that it was a good movie he was telling me some information about it and said that it is a really good movie to watch. I recently just watched Lock and Key on Netflix and it was surprisingly good. I thought that it would be boring but it was really interesting. I think you should go with your fiance- it will not be boring- and it will give you two to have a nice evening out and not be stuck at home. Once this whole covid 19 is gone I would love to go watch it. Another one that I really wanted to see in the movies was Fantasy Island that one looked like it would be good.. Yes once we can get out again- I have seen the Fantasy Island trailer-Also Greyhound with Tom Hanks looks good-. never heard of greyhound, what did you think of Fantasy Island. Fantasy Island sounds like fun- I saw the trailer to that also. The late 70's tv show was very lame- I was a kid then. movies aren't like they were back when we were younger. You may like Greyhound it is a true story against the odds theme-. thank you I accept your recommendation and am excited to watch it. Cool- you guys have fun. thanks you too hope this Covid 19 passes and you can get out to the movies.. Yes in NYC so we are stressed about it- anyway have fun. I live in New York but I live in the country. ", ". Hey there! I hear you're interested in movies. May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy?. Absolutely! I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview. Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore?. I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field. 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?. I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol. Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?. I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!!. That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!. I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat!. For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested!. I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-). Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films!. I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much!. It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure!. I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?. I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?. Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like?.

Frozen 2 is a nice movie but not as good as the first part. Let it go i still sing the song when i am playful.. Yeh! i felt the same was not so interesting as Part 1. It was a little flop..

Yes, I am! Do you have any recommendations for what's out there?What does everyone seem to want to see?. There are all kinds of things out right now- what kind of movies do you like to see? Are there any genres that you don't like?. Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad. I don't like a lot of violence and language. I guess I'm in the mood for a feel good movie. Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting.. I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking! What is the last movie you watched if you don't mind my asking?. I last saw Little Women. It was good. I liked most of the actors. Maybe now I'm looking for something with a little more adventure. Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho.. Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation?. I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals.

I like classics because I feel like the newer movies arent as well made and there are alot of remakes out. What are your favorite classics?. Rear Window is my favorite! Classic Hitchcock. Most brilliant film I have ever seen. It was the first time I saw subtext painted by camerawork and could see the story he was painting underneath the main story. Amazing..

", ". Hi how are you!. I'm great! Thank you! I'm looking for a new movie recommendation in horror.. Oh great! What is the last horror movie you watched?. The last one I watched was It Chapter Two. I liked it.. Have you ever seen Annabelle 2?. I saw the first one and didn't think it was all that good. So I didn't see the second one.. Gotcha! I actually totally agree with you on that statement.. I do know of a movie that I want to see because I think it will be good. It's called Doctor Sleep.. ", ". Hello! I'm here to help you with finding a good movie! What are some of your favorite movies currently?. Hi, i like to see the Irishman. That's a good movie! Do you want to watch something similar to that?. Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind?. So you enjoy realistic movies? If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary?. Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's?. Yes, I do! I like documentaries that focus around mysteries. Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows. That's probably why! Do you like true crime?. Totally like them! Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it. I don't like movies which are violent. Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?. I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies?. I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster.. I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that?. OOOO im totally afraid of that one. It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself?. How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these?. They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites?. I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that?. I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy?. I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise!. I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look. Is there a fight scene you like in a particular movie?. I don't really watch movies with fight scenes. So you would want to watch IT?. Sure I will give it a try. Keeping the remote nearby!.

Is that what you look for when searching for a movie?. Slight humor works fine. Is it good to watch with kids?. I would say that it could be slightly emotional, but it is a great movie to watch with the family for sure. So many lessons taught and important ones too!. Ok. I accept this movie recommendation.. So would you like to watch the trailer?. Yes. before that do you have any other suggestion?. I definitely could. What are other things that you look for in movies?. some romantic new movies?. Ah sorry, I'm not too well endowed with Romantic movies. What other genres do you like?. one more family oriented movie.. Have you seen Incredibles or Incredibles 2? Definitely one that incorporates the whole family and is a blast to watch with kids. Action, with humor, and overall great.. no. I haven't. Is both the stories connected. Or like second part is continuation of the first part.?. They are connected through plotlines and all. In fact, Incredibles 2 came out over 10 years after the first one was made so the animation is so different but both are great. Do you like animated movies?. Yes, I do.

Do you want to watch something similar to that?. Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind?. So you enjoy realistic movies? If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary?. Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's?. Yes, I do! I like documentaries that focus around mysteries. Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows. That's probably why! Do you like true crime?. Totally like them! Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it. I don't like movies which are violent. Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?. I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies?. I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster.. I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that?. OOOO im totally afraid of that one. It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself?. How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these?. They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites?. I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that?. I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy?. I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise!. I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look. Is there a fight scene you like in a particular movie?. I don't really watch movies with fight scenes.

If you're looking to be more scared I'd recommend Us.. A strong plot is definitely important. I think I'll go with Get Out and follow with Us if I like the former.. Awesome. The plot to Get Out is superb and once your done definitely check out an interview with Peele, there are so many hidden double meanings and symbols.

My personal favorite is Casino Royale, one of the more contemporary ones. However, Goldfinger is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old!. I like that one, where he robs the Federal Reserve. Sweet, good choice, that is what I will go with, Goldfinger. I'm glad to hear that! I hope you enjoy it.. Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night.. It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think Casino Royale would be a great second choice if that works for you. In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery.. I think that will work, as that particular one does a good job channeling the older Bond films. Thanks for the effort, and recommendation.. Of course, it was my pleasure.. Have you seen the Bond where he gets married? It is the one with the one-off Bond actor, in-between Connery and Moore. I dont think I have, what year did it come out?. 69, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. He is seen as the Bond closest to the character based in Fleming's Books about Bond. Thats interesting, considering it seems very out of his playboy character to get married.. Definitely, it is a different Bond, in tone. If you like Bond, and want a goofy version check out, In Like Flint, reminds me of an early Austin Powers. ", ". Hello! What genre of movies do you love?. i love comedy movies the most. a good action movie once in a while as well. Ok, same here!

Yes! What type of comedy doesn't appeal to you? And have you seen Blockers?. I like all types of comedy as long as it's not boring! I have no seen Blockers. Is it good?. Yes! It is hilarious!

I think you should watch The Monuments Men, it is so great and also features Bill Murray just like Rushmore!. That was a pretty good movie, little slow though.. You should give it another shot. I will have to do that. I watched it in a film history class for my major and it was quite possibly the best movie to write a report on!. sometimes when you watch a movie again it has a different affect on you. I completely agree! I recently gave it a second chance and it made the world of a difference. I agree I will watch your recommendation. ", ". Hello! I am here to give you some recommendations!

Hi! I am here to help recommend a movie for you today.. Great! I am looking for psychological thrillers, do you know of any good ones?. I know of some really great ones. Have you ever seen Donnie Darko?. I have not! But have definitely heard of it before. I'll definitely have to check that one out, but am curious if you know of any more recent films?. What about the movie Get Out!?. I have been meaning to watch that one, actually. I will accept that recommendation! Thank you. Awesome! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Yes, sure!. Great. The trailer should begin after the chat is finished. I hope you enjoy it.. Ok, thanks again for the recommendation. Before we finish, are there any other movies that you also be interested in? There are a few others in the thriller category that I think that you would like.. Sure, I am open to more ideas!. There was a fairly recent one that came out called Split, which also had a sequel called Glass. Have you heard of either of these?. I haven't. What are they about?. Split is based on the idea that a man kidnaps three girls, but the kicker is that he has 23 unique personalities. And apparently there is a 24th personality that is really horrible that has yet to come out yet. So the girls try to escape before the 24th comes out.. Oh wow! That sounds creepy and definitely thrilling. What about Glass?. Its the sequel to Split, and focuses on the 24th personality being used as a weapon.. Both of those seem like movies I would be interested in. One of my favorite psychological thrillers is Shutter Island. Do you know of any movies similar to that?. ", ". Hi, do you like movies/. Yes I love movies!. What genre do you enjoy most?. I really like dark comedies- do you have any recommendations?. What is your favorite dark comedy?. I like The Lobster a lot. Did you ever see Fargo?. I actually have not seen it. The story is about greed and is comedic as well. sounds great! I'll accept the recommendation. ", ". Hello, how are you doing? What type of movies do you prefer?. I usally like supherhero movies. Who's your favorite superhero?. dark knight. So a Batman fan I see.. What other superheros do you like?. mmmm iron man was good.

Well, since you're a big fan of Batman, would you watch the trailer for Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker?. yes of course. I saw it when I was a little bit younger, definitely an amazing movie.. yes it was. I was a big fan of Will Friedle's performance. yes he was great'.

Just like any action movie, but I'd like one with more action kind of like Fast and Furious. Ok, I got you now. I'm guessing you're looking for more modern, and not old 80's movies like Rambo, lol. Yeah, not Rambo right now. Have some kids I need to entertain. Ok, I got it. So you can't have a lot of profanity either, right? Or is that not an issue?. Just not an R rated movie. A couple swears here and there is fine.. How do you feel about the Expendables?. Oh, I definitely wouldn't be opposed to that. What's the plot like?. You're got oldies but goodies like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Harrison Ford added to a huge team to take down a rival co-founder.. That seems like a great movie to watch with the kids. Have you ever watched the movie?. I've seen it and thought it was great fun. Let the kids see even old people can be cool, lol. Yeah, I definitely agree. Do you know the length of the movie?. 2 hours and 11 minutes. Ok, that's short enough to keep the kids occupied for the whole movie. Is it on any streaming services such as Netflix?. It's on Amazon Prime, YouTube (with fee), or even iTunes if you don't have Prime.. Ok, that's perfect. I think we'll be watching the Expendables this weekend. Thanks for the recommendation!.

How about yourself?. Doing well. I hear you are interested in movies?. I love movies! Definitely one of my passions. Same! It's what my degree is in, actually. Do you have a favorite genre?. I like indie and coming of age stories. I'm also always down for a good horror film.. Have you seen the film Us? Got some interesting family dynamics, which is also important in all of the good coming of age films, etc. Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie vibe, etc. Think you might like it!. Yes I did see it! I thought Lupita Nyongo's performance was amazing. And definitely agree about the family dynamics part.. Got it. Nice! The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a psychological thriller kind of way... Ever seen Pi by Darren Aronofsky?. No I haven't! But I love psychological thrillers, what's that one about?. Seen ANY Aronofsky films? They all have some thematic similarities. Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly.. yes! I've seen Black Swan and Mother! Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling. I definitely suggest Pi then. It's a little more claustrophobic than Black Swan, but in a way that suits the obsession theme well.. it sounds so good. I definitely am interested in that and accept that recommendation. Sounds great! Enjoy! I wrote a scholarly article on Aronofsky and am definitely a fan. I hope you are too! Check out all of his stuff once you get time to.. I absolutely will.

I prefer straight drama, but also well-crafted science fiction, like Alien and Aliens.. Okay, let me see it this one sounds interesting to you! The first drama, sci fi that comes to mind Is The Butterfly Effect, it came out in 204, with Aston Kutcher. Its about a man who suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. As he grows up, he finds a way to remember these lost memories and a supernatural way to alter his life by reading his journal...

It is about a man who falls in love with a girl who works at the same restaurant as him. Hmmmm that sounds interesting. But if we are looking for something more current, what would you recommend?. I think you might like Long Shot from 2019. I saw that one over the summer, it was great!. ", ". Hello there!. Hi friend!. Tell me, what kind of movies do you like?. Cheeky Comedy movies tend to be my favorite right now. Family movies such as Disney are always lovable. Funny you ask, I am actually looking for a recommendation.. Glad to hear! You should check out Shazam! It's very funny and fun and if you're a Disney fan definitely watch Toy Story 4.. Shazam was an awesome movie I must say. I would watch it again however i must accept your second recommendation of Toy Story 4. Those were amazing movies and I specifically like the first one the most. Although that is my stance, it may soon change after watching the 4th one. In my best Woody voice: Thanks partner. Also check out the comedy classic Groundhog Day, Bill Murray is great in it. Also, if the kids are pokemon fans give Detective Pikachu a chance.. Bill Murray is a very famous actor and has been in quite a few movies now. He is easily one of the greatest to do it. I have heard of Groundhog Day and maybe seen it before but wouldn't hurt to check it out. I have heard great things about that new movie detective Pikachu, I believe it has Ryan Reynolds as the main character of course other than Pikachu. Fun movie think that came out this year?. Definitely check out Jojo Rabbit, it was written and directed by the director of Thor Ragnarok, Taika Waititi. You can also check out Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.. Got it.

I like Avengers and Marvel Spiderman a lot. oh wow. you surprised me with the superheros! A good recent drama I would recommend would be the art of racing in the rain. Have you seen it?. No, what is it about?. its a drama featuring the lead actor from this is us. it has a bit of everything family and relationships, a dog whose thoughts you can hear!, sports, comedy..... Wow, that sounds fun :). it is fun in parts and tear jerker in others. I like that it has parts of different types of movies in it. So it is a bit of everything instead of being pigeon holed in one genre or story.. Please tell me more!. the lead actor is a race car driver. he has a dog whose thoughts we can hear by the voice of kevin costner. amanda seyfriend is the love interest. not sure if you would know her or not. she's sort of popular.. I'm not familiar with her, but I like Kevin Costner. yeah, I like his work too...especially his westerns. he does a great job being the voice of the dog.

The plot was innovative, nuanced, and entirely credible. How does that sound?. It looks really cool. I accept the recommendation!. Excellent! Diane Kruger gives a quietly intense, steely performance in this action thriller.. Yeah! I like what I see so far plot wise... but I also see it's kinda lowly ranked on Rotten Tomatoes. Perhaps something with a higher rating but similar in style?. Okay, What is the last movie that you watched?. Un-related, but I watched Jojo Rabbit in theaters. I enjoyed it. Oh yes that movie was pretty funny.. It was funny, but it also was sad. I hated that Jojo's mother died.. That was a difficult scene. I remember you said you like spy and action movies. The Angel has fallen is about Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler who framed for the attempted assassination of the President. It also has Morgan Freeman in it.. Yeah!

Apparently M Turk doesn't have Hot Fuzz when I search, lol, but at least you can look for it on your own. Have you seen Zombieland?. Yes we just went to Zombieland 2 in the theater over the weekend.

It is streaming on Amazon Prime Video. It has so much of the classic Seth Rogan humor in it and adds a light hearted take on the whole North Korean situation.

Any ideas??. I really enjoy all of the Marvel movies. One of my more recent favorite Marvel movies was Captain Marvel. I enjoyed the historical aspects of it as well as the difference that was a female lead.. I loved Endgame..Captain Marvel is a great recommendation - it might even fill in the missing gaps for me in Endgame. I will take you up on that recommendation. Thank you!.. Is there a trailer for it? I was also thinking about the new Star Wars movie that is coming out on Dec 20th. Haven't see a trailer though.. There is a trailer for Captain Marvel! Did you want me to find a link for it? I'm also looking forward to the new star wars movie, and have seen the trailers that they play every once and awhile on TV!. If you have a link for Captain Marvel...that would be great! I'll keep a look out for the Star Wars Trailer, too. DId you know that Black Widow from the MCU is coming out with a movie in 2020? I would love to see that trailer!!!. Here is a link to the captain marvel trailer! I heard that there was going to be a Black Widow movie coming out but I'm not sure how it's going to work becuase of what happened in Endgame - but I am excited to see it and see what happens!. Thanks for the link and the recommendation. I will be watching Captain Marvel tonight. I think the Black Widow movie will be pre-Endgame and from a timeline standpoint occur between the 2 Avengers movies. Thanks again for the idea!. You're Welcome! I'll be intrigued to see it!.

Hmm..the Martian. Haven't seen it - is it with Matt Damon? I think I know that one. Another great recommendation. I'll take you up on that. Thanks!. It is! I believe it came out about 4 years ago, but it's a very good movie. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat!. Do you know anything about the movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman?

I was surprised that I had never heard of it and especially becasue Cate Blanchett is in big movies such as Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Ocean's 8, etc. She really is a great actress I think.

Especially with Harry Potter and Star Wars movies. They are not really part of my favorite genre, but I have watched a few from each series. Have you watched Harry Potter or Star Wars?. Yeah Ive seen all of the Harry Potter movies but i've seen only some of the Star Wars movies. I really like both franchises though.. I am the opposite. I have seen only some of Harry Potter and almost all of Star Wars. I think they both are a nice change. Yeah I really like both. It's interesting to see how Star Wars paved the way for a story like Harry Potter, their plots both follow the cycle of the hero's journey.. Yes isn't that interesting? I am glad that someone else sees that connection as well. Both are a great series, just takes a long time to finish them!. Yes I think both series also set a standard for having multiple sequels to movies now, mostly as a cash grab, since I don't think their have been many series that have come out recently that are that interesting. I think after Hunger Games we haven't really had any good movie series come out that weren't piggybacking off of the Hunger Games dystopia hype.. Yes I agree! It is crazy how hard it is to find a quality movie these days because of the great movies that were made in the past.. Yes especially with all of the reboots too!. ", ". Hello!. hey there. ", ". Hi! what kind of movies do you like?. I'm looking for a really good movie with action, a good plot and excitement/suspense. Do you have any good recomendation for me?. I really enjoyed The Quiet Place. It's about aliens that attack if they hear you. Most of the movie doesn't have a soundtrack, so every noise is suspenseful.. Interesting. I have never heard of that movie before, but I'm not really into aliens. Could you recommend a movie to me with humans in it? Maybe something along the lines of government plots?. Have you seen the Jason Bourne movies? A man with amnesia is being chased by government agents. He has to figure out who he is and what they want.. Yes! I LOVE that movie! That is a great recommendation. But I've already watched the entire series. Do you have any other government movies that you could recommend for me?. Argo has lots of suspense. Six people from the US Embassy in Iran have to go into hiding after Islamists attack.. Now that sounds very interesting. I'm going to take that recommendation. Thank you so much for taking the time to offer me such a great suggestion. I very much appreciate it. Please have a great day!. Have a good one!. Oh. I'm sorry. That last recommendation was so good, I don't know what to do when I'm finished watching that one LoL! Can you offer me a few more suggestions?. The Mission Impossible Movies are good if you want something a little more light-hearted.. That's another great series also. I watched the entire thing. Do you have some more?. If you don't mind super hero flick, Captain America Winter Soldier has political intrigue.. I love the dynamic of politics in super hero genres. Good choice. How about something romantic with drama.. I haven't seen this one but my sister loved Silver Linings Playbook with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper.. I haven't seen that one either, but heard about it. I'm going to accept that recommendation. Thank you for that. Do you have any recommendations about fast supercars?. Fast and Furious movies! These have action and drama as well. Some funny parts too.. I thought that you might recommend that :-) Great choice. I've seen them all. How about a good documentary about the industrial revolution?. I don't watch many documentaries.

I like movies that aren't predictable and have a combination of comedy and action.. Darn I haven't seen that one. Hmm, let me think unpredictable action comedy.... I also saw Snowpiercer the day before and liked it a lot - more than Parasite.. Yea, Snowpiercer had some real speed to it. Though both it and Parasite had very pretty cinematography. Do you prefer that prettier more artistic style to a blockbuster action like the new Mission Impossible?. It depends on how I'm feeling in the moment but I usually go for more light hearted films that are easy to digest.. Ahh for a moment I was thinking maybe you'd be interested in another Bong Joon-ho film. The Host is more action packed a 'la Snowpiercer but it does have some white-knuckled horror moments.. I would be interested! What is The Host about?. When toxic waste and American hegemony collide nature(?) produces a monster that puts innocent people at risk. Working together a family must .... That makes me want to learn more about it. I'll definitely look more into it and watch the trailers, etc. I accept your recommendation :).. Great! I hope you enjoy it. Nice chatting.. Are there any actors I would recognize in The Host?. Kang-ho Song the father from Parasite also in Snowpiercer is in the movie.. That's great! I love his acting.

What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. Hello! I like Comedy, Heroes and History Movies. Awesome! When you say history movies, do you mind if they are war movies?. I used to like war movies but now I like them about 20%. Okay! What kind of heroes do you like? Do you like the Marvel/DC Universe type heroes? Or are you open to other kinds? For example, have you heard of I Am Number Four?. Yes I like the Marvel heroes. Never heard of I am Number Four. Awesome! I am Number Four is an exciting and gripping movie about these persons that have powers called legacies. It is based off of a book series. The movie received a lot of good reviews from people that enjoy hero and action. Watching the film actually made me read the series. The trailer is here, if you want to check it out and let me know what you think!. How Many series are there?? And yes I can check the trailer.. This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic. OH wow the movie look very interesting, I wanna see it. Do you have any other recommendation?. Yes! Have you ever seen the movie Hancock with Will Smith? It is an awesome movie about a homeless superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers responsibly, and his growth as he becomes a better superhero.. Yeah I have seen That one.. Awesome! That was a fun movie. Speaking of fun, have you heard about the new Eddie Murphy comedy coming out? It is called Dolemite Is My Name. I am putting it up in a recommendation if you would like to check it out!. Yes i have heard of it. And yeah go ahead. Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named The King that is available on Netflix!

Greetings fellow movie buff. Good Morning friend.. Did you have an opportunity to catch any films this past weekend. I have not, what's a good one that'd you'd suggest for a fellow to watch? One that could really grip your attention without leaving to many plot holes with a all-around good setting, script, cast and directing?. I am holding out til later this week to catch the new Clint Eastwood movie Jewell. Tell me about it? What's the plot to the movie? Do you think it'll be a good movie, even if the media isn't covering it hardcore like the upcoming Star Wars or past Avengers?. It revolves around the Atlanta olympics bombing suspect Richard Jewell .. I'll have to look into this movie then, sounds like a plausible winner.. I am not too in to the Star Wars or superhero movies. I prefer realistic stories. They've never been my taste either, but the media covers them like no tomorrow. Whilst leaving moving deserving of coverage marooned.. Got it. So a movie like 'American Sniper' would be more your glass of wine then?. ", ". ", ". hello!! how are you today? what kind of movies do you like to watch?. Hi there. I'm well. Thanks for asking. I like a lot of different kinds of movies, but I'm especially in the mood for a good Christmas movie.. That's lovely to hear may i make a suggestion? to you i used to love watching it as a kid every December with my family.. I'd love to hear any suggestions you might have. Watching movies together was always a holiday tradition for us as well.. rudolph the red nosed reindeer original claymation film. was a family favorite of ours and the original animate Grinch was my favorite as a kid. i feel it has alot built in to the 2 films with american Christmas culture. Those are two of my favorites for sure. But I'm looking for something a little different. Not a cartoon. And nothing too cheesy. Something that's more comedy than drama.. oooh i have a good suggesting what about elf staring Will Ferrel its about Buddy (Will Ferrell) was accidentally transported to the North Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa's elves.. That sounds perfect! I accept the recommendation. Thank you.. is their any more recommendations you are looking for ?. No I think that sounds perfect.. ok have have a lovely night and happy holiday. You too. Thanks again for the recommendation.. i do appoligize for my late delays in replies my typing is a little slow. That's quite alright. I think we still need to chat a few more times before the system recognizes that we have a succesful recommendation.. may i make a another suggestion you must watch The Night Before. I actually started that one, but lost interest. Maybe I should give it another shot.. how about Mixed Nuts its a wonderful classic comedy. I've never heard of it, but the cast looks awesome so I'll definitely check that one out. Thanks!. is there anything else i can help you with this evening?. No thanks.

That's great! The last movie I saw was Avengers Endgame. I liked that it brought together all the Marvel heroes from the different universes to fight for a common cause. The only thing I did not like was the limitations placed on Captain Marvel's superpowers.. I haven't seen that movie yet and have been wanting to watch it so very bad. I know I will love it!.

I liked the suspense. Perfect! I think based on your fondness of drama and suspense, you would greatly enjoy Marriage Story. It stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. It's a dramatic look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. Lots of drama, suspense and love.. Sounds good, I will watch that, thank you.

I love that over jump scares and senseless gore.. Ok, awesome. Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer?. Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already.. It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best.. Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as Hitchcock-ian?. I will do my best to find something you haven't seen!. Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film!.

Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies.. I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!. Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!. Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?. Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.. Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J. Thanks again! Have a good one :). Hey I think I can actually send this trailer to you if you would like?. Actually that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. Thanks!. Of course. I am working on getting that over to you now or I can send you a link to the right one.. Okay thanks, I appreciate it as i'm not too savvy on the computer. Do you have a link by chance?. You got it! Also, What was the last thing you saw Will Smith in aside from this movie you are going to watch tonight?. Perfect, thanks! I would have to say the latest release of Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence. I can't remember if the name is Bad Boys 3 or a spinoff name like Bad Boys Reloaded - Also I wanted to see him in Gemini Man but never did. Have you heard how that movie is or seen it?. I have seen Gemini Man and I have to say maybe not his best work but was still entertaining for something lazy and entertaining. Also, I love the Bad Boys series lol. They remind me of my childhood.. Haha yes! Did you watch the Fresh Prince of Bel Air at all? I did as kid. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. Hi, thanks for your help. No Problem! Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. Either a recent drama or a comedy. Okay, Sounds like fun! What is the last movie that you watched?. Hmmm, I think it was The Santa Clause lol. Nice! Getting into the holiday spirit! I was thinking about A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It is a story based off of Mister Rodgers and is played by Tom Hanks. It looks quite inspiring and uplifting. A feel good movie.. Aww, I loved his show when I was younger. I actually think I'd like to see that movie.. I was thinking about this movie trailer because he does have a major cultural impact on America and fits how you like drama movies and I am sure it is fun and humorous. I think it's a good recommendation. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Sure, I'll watch it. Thank you! Hope you have a great day!. you too, thanks!. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Hi!

Hello! How are you today.. Fine and you. I am good! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. Yes of course, I love action movies a lot. What was the last action movie that you watched?. Have you seen Gemini Man?. I have! I enjoy the work of the director, Ang Lee, a lot.. Yeah it is a great movie and some other got high recommendations too. Yes it is! Another good action movie that I enjoyed greatly was Mission Impossible: Fallout. Have you seen this movie yet?. You can bet your money on that I have seen it, have you seen shaw and hobbs?. Yes I have! It was a very fun experience to watch that movie in the theater. It reminded me of my experience watching John Wick 3.. Oh, that is the greatest of all lately, I enjoy watching it over again.. Are you looking for a movie that has a similar story to any of these films we've talked about?. I won't mind if I get one or two from you. If you enjoyed John Wick, I would recommend a movie called The Raid 2. It's a foreign film with a very similar storyline to John Wick and has earned many accolades.. That is great, I will add that to my cart now and see that movie soonest. I think you will enjoy it. It has nonstop action just like it's predecessor. However, it's not necessary to watch the first film in order to understand the second, much like John Wick.. Ok, I will do some findings on that, thanks for the recommendation. I accept the recommendation. ", ". hi i'm here,how are you?. I am great, thank you for asking. How are you?. yes i'm great,you like movies.. I do. I love sci-fi movies the most.. oh! you watch lion movie trailer.. Do you mean the Lion King?. yes i mean lion king.. I watched the trailer and movie. Loved it!. oh! i like it movie.. Do you have any recommendations on movies to watch? I also like movies with plot twists and mysteries. Occasionally I watch Bollywood movies, too.. ", ". Hello.. Good morning!. Can I help you find a movie today?. Yes, that would be great! I am looking for a comedy.. Okay, what was the last movie you watched?. The last movie I watched was Knives Out, which was a comedic thriller. It was great!. Okay, do you prefer to see a comedic thriller, or just any comedy in general?. Great question, I think at this time I'd like just a comedy.. Thanks for that. Is there a specific actor/actress you'd like to see?. Not particularly, but I love any actor or actress from Saturday Night Live.. How about one with Will Ferrell? He was very popular on SNL.. YES! He is one of the best!:). I'd like to recommend Holmes & Watson. It's relatively new, from last year, and features Will Ferrell and also John C. Reilly.. I haven't even heard about this movie before. Do you have a brief synopsis?. Sure thing, it's a kind of satirical take on the story about Sherlock Holmes. Are you familiar with Sherlock Holmes?. Yes, of course! So, if this is a Sherlock Holmes like film, my guess this is more of a Comedic Mystery? Is that accurate?.

What kind of movies do you like?. I would an horror movie, something to get my adrenaline pumping. Let's see. Do you like any of the Purge movies?. Not really, but I've seen them. Do you like traditional horror movies, ie - chainsaw, masks. Or do you like 'new' horror movies that are more psychologically draining.... would prefer the later. ", ". Hello, may I assist you in finding a good movie?. Yes please! I am looking for a comedy movie similar to Step Brothers. I'm more than happy to find a similar movie. May I ask the name of an additional recent comedy movie that you have seen to better assist me in this search?. I also enjoyed The Campaign. I am a fan of Will Farrell.. Perhaps you would enjoy the movie Anchorman staring Will Ferrell. He plays the role of a new anchor in the 1970's and is intimidated by a new female co-anchor in a male dominated industry of broadcasting.. Excellent! I will be sure to check it out. Thank you for your help!. Your welcome! Enjoy!. Have you seen this movie?. Yes, I have. It's one of my favorites. There is multiple movies in the series.. How many movies are there in the series?. Two thus far. There is speculation of a third edition.. Do you like the first or the second one better?. In my opinion, the original is always the best.. I tend to agree!. So would you care to watch the trailer?. Yes I would!. Would you like the both trailers?. Why not? That way I can evaluate both movies.. ", ". Hi there, I understand you are trying to find a movie trailer that interests you?. Yes, I am! Do you have any recommendations for what's out there?What does everyone seem to want to see?. There are all kinds of things out right now- what kind of movies do you like to see? Are there any genres that you don't like?. Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad. I don't like a lot of violence and language. I guess I'm in the mood for a feel good movie. Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting.. I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking! What is the last movie you watched if you don't mind my asking?. I last saw Little Women. It was good. I liked most of the actors. Maybe now I'm looking for something with a little more adventure. Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho.. Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation?. I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals. Like A Dog's Purpose. Very well done,but that was a while ago. Just thought there might be something similar out.. I understand! Have you read anything about the new Dolittle movie? It just recently came out in January so is relatively new. If not, what is it about that movie that disinterests you?. Oh yea! I haven't really read anything recently, but isn't that the one with Robert Downey Jr.?nWhat is it rated?. It is! It is rated PG, so a little more geared towards children however it combines action & adventure with comedy- a feel good movie you might say!. Hey! I think that is a great idea! As long as it's not rated G, it works for me. Not a fan of sitting in a theater with a bunch of little kids. I do like me some Robert Downey Jr! :) I will take your recommendation! Thank You!. Great! I sure hope you enjoy it! He is a great actor. I do feel that this one is the best adaptation of all of the Dolittle movies. Have you seen any of the older ones?. Yes, I saw the one with the guy from My Fair Lady, but that was a long time ago. Thanks again.. Yeah the other ones are pretty old and not my favorite to be honest. Did you ever seen the original one? It won a bunch of awards back in the day!. Not sure if it was the original or not, but it was the musical one. I actually liked it very mucn but I like musicals. They don't have many of those anymore. Mama Mia was good! Like most movies they should quit while they are ahead because the second one wasn't so good. Same thing happened with Grease.. Agreed! I was disappointed by the second Mama Mia as well, but know some who enjoyed it. I never did see the next Grease- what did you not like about it?. It did not have the original cast and the music just didn't have a spark.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Have you heard of Midsommar?", "I'll send you the original first.", "That is a shame.

Clint Eastwood is really good in that movie.. Yes he plays a great role as a Marine. Have you seen Platoon?. Yes, but years ago. Ok, what about Full Metal Jacket? It's a Kubrick film so it may not be for everyone.. It was great. Do you remember the lead actor. Wasn't it Matthew Modine?. What about the Marine Gunny. Do you remember him?. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Thank you...do you have a recommendation?. First, what are your movie interests?. I like many movie genres, like romance, comedies, suspense, and thrillers.. I was really impressed with Joker, The Irishman, or for something a little lighter I recommend Toy Story 4.. I've been wanting to see the Joker but haven't yet.. It is a really interesting movie and Joaquin Phoenix rendition of the Joker is very captivating.. That's what I heard, I really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance of the joker before is Joaquin's performance comparable?. I think what makes both of them so good is that they are shown with very different characteristics and do it very well. In this movie with Joaquin we have an origin story that keeps your attention.. Thanks for your recommendation of the Joker. I'd like to see that movie.. Id like to offer you this trailer.. Thak you, I'd really like to see that movie now.. Very nice, I am glad I could help.. What is the Irsihman movie about?. It is based on a true story regarding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. The main character played by Robert De Niro is Frank Sheeran and he was mob hitman the became good friends with Hoffa.. That sounds very interesting and I like movies based on true stories, especially with a great actor like Robert De Niro.. Yes this was just released on Netflix just last week but it is a long move, 3.5 hours long. In both these movies I do predict that they will be well represented during award season..

Hi, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Hi. What could you recommend?. What type of movies are you into? Comedy, romance, thrillers?. Comedy is my favorite.. Perfect, what is the latest comedy that you saw?. The last comedy I saw was Christmas Vacation.. Nice, have you seen Grown Ups, the original or number two?. Yes I have seen and love both!. How about Good Boys or Night School?. I haven't seen either. I've heard about Night School but I don't recall Good Boys. What is that about?. Kids that skip school and have a chaotic day. Yeah, Night School is my favorite and I totally recommend that you watch that!. Since you like it so much, I'll have to check out Night School.. Have you watched the trailer before or seen anything about it?. I think I saw a commercial for it on TV. It has Kevin Hart in it right?. ", ". ", ". Hi! I hope I can find a movie you would really like to see.. What movie do you recommend?. I have some good recommendations but I was wondering what genre you like enjoy the most?. I like thrillers and comedy mostly, and things with a good cinematography, though i Gotta be in the mood for it. Have you seen the movie Hustlers yet? It is a little bit of a mix of comedy, drama and thriller.. No I haven't, what's it about?. It's about a group of former strippers who work together to turn the tables on their wall street clients. Ahhhh interesting, is it like a laugh-out-loud comedy, or like a quiet chuckle?. A lot of it is laugh out loud, but it is also a make you want to see what happens next kind of movie.. Who stars in it?. Jennifer Lopez, Julia Stiles and Constance Wu. Well, I could probably get into that, I liked Jennifer Lopez in Enough. Yeah, I think this is one of her better movies.. My wife is actually right here, she said she wanted to watch your movie actually, so her and I are both going to watch it haha. I think you will both enjoy it! There is another movie I am thinking of that is more of a thriller, it is called Gemini man. What's that about? And who's in it?. It stars Will Smith and it is about a hit man who is being targeted for hit by a younger version of himself! It is very exciting!. Ooph I like Will Smith a lot too, not always the best guy for serious roles though, is it better than his last few serious movies?. I think he has come a long way in this one, it is definitely worth watching. If it's like Enemy of the State or I Am Legend I'll probably give it a watch, if it's like Hancock or that one After Earth I'll probably pass.

I like comedy and family movies.. I can't wait to give you some recommendations. What was the last movie you watched?. Frozen 2 was the last one I watched. Oh wow! That's the last movie I watched too. I was glad Disney+ released it early. I'm guessing you've seen most of the recent Disney releases, correct?. Absolutely! I love Disney movies! Pets 2 was a good one too!. I haven't seen that one yet. You may have turned me on to a new movie :) Are you looking for a movie to watch with kids? Are you looking for something similar to Frozen 2?. It was a really cute movie! My kids loved it! Yes! My kids and I do movies all weekend.. That's so nice! I loved movie nights growing up. Have you heard of the movie Troop Zero on Amazon Prime?. No I haven't heard of that one!. I haven't watched that one yet, but I just added it to my Watchlist. It has Viola Davis, Jim Gaffigan and Allison Janney in it. A great cast. If you're looking for a cartoon though, I think I would recommend Spies In Disguise. Did you catch that one yet?. No I haven't caught that one yet either! Troop zero is definitely going on my watch list! Cartoon is more for my family! My children are under 10 years old. I'll have to check out Spies in Disguise. I'm over watching Tangled and Zootopia over and over. Haha I can only imagine! (Also a strong recommendation for when the kids aren't around is Knives Out. It's my top movie for the year.) Would you like to watch the trailer for Spies in Disguise?. Thanks for the recommendations! I would love to watch the trailer for Spies in Disguise!. Awesome! I hope you enjoy it!. Thanks! I'm sure we will! Have you checked out Deadpool 2?. Yes! What a hilarious movie. Lol now that one I would not recommend with the kids around. No if course not! I haven't had a chance to check it out but the first one was awesome.. I don't think it was as funny as the first, but it's hard to compete. I watched another pretty funny movie called Good Boys that came out last year that was so funny. The majority of the cast are kids but its rated R. My goodness it was hilarious.. Definitely checking that one out as well! I definitely accept all of your movie recommendations! You have a great taste in movies! Thanks. ", ". Hi. hi, do you like movies?. I do, I am into comedy and action the most. What about you?. i really liked both Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, but i also love comedies. which ones have you seen recently and can recommend?. I recommend Long Shot with Seth Rogen. His role is different that his other movies so it was interesting watching him. It was a good movie that I would recommend.. I don't know anything about this movie. Do you have any other suggestions?. Good Boys is another good comedy. Same producers as Super bad.. I don't know anything about this movie either. How about something more mainstream? Something that sold a lot of tickets?. Toy Story 4 was a big hit and also very good. It will bring out your inner kid.. That sounds like a great idea. I love Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. I will go see Toy Story 4 this weekend. Thank you for this recommendation.. Sure thing. I think you will enjoy it.. You also said you like action movies.

I'm not sure why but the combination of Mark Wahlberg's seriousness and Will Farrell's comedy pair up well.. I agree! They complement each other well..

Okay, that was with Denzel Washington. If you haven't seen it yet I would recomment the Equalizer II movie trailer? It is an action movie.. Yea sure, that sounds good. Great! You will enjoy Denzel Washington in this movie.. Nice, cant wait. there is also the first movie Equalizer along with Man on Fire also with Denzel Washington. Ive seen both of those. Safe House, American Gangster, Faller, Unstoppable are Action movies as well. Sure Safe House sounds good. Safe Hluse had 7 nominations and won 1 award. It should be a satisfying movie experience. Great that sounds good, cant wait to watch it. Don't forget the popcorn, enjoy!. Already have it ready!. Do you have a specific actor you enjoy watching for your action movies?. I grew up watching alot of Jason Statham movies. So id say I like his movies the most. What about you?. Bruce Willis and his many Die Hard movies. I especially enjoyed Tom Cruise in his 3 Mission Impossible movies? Have you seen any of these. I have not seen any of the Die Hard movies, but I love Bruce Willis's movies.

I think you might like the movie called Last Christmas. What is it about?. It's about a woman who has made some bad decisions but finds a man who is special. I think I will have to take a look at that one. Her life seems to take a better turn when she meets Tom.. Sounds like a good movie, I will definitely be putting it on my list. It has an interesting twist to it that will warm your heart!. Around this time of the year, I like to watch movies like that. ", ". Hi there, I hear you're looking for a movie?. Hi, you heard right!. What was the latest movie that you saw and liked?. I watched Us recently and I liked that a lot. Us is a great movie! Do you like horror movies in general?. It depends - I don't like horror movies that are just gore or things jumping out, but I like movies that are suspenseful and keep you guessing. Have you seen any Ari Aster movies? They're pretty scary and suspenseful.. I've never heard of them - what are some of their movies?. Midsommer and Hereditary, one is about a couple going to Sweden and finding a cult, and one is about a family haunted by demons.. Oh okay! I've seen Hereditary and I've heard about Midsommer but I wasn't sure if I would like it - it seemed to get mixed reviews. It's weird but visually really beautiful and worth watching.. okay cool I'll maybe check it out! Do you have any other recommendations? I also like documentaries. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a really cute and fun documentary about a man who has a famous sushi restaurant. What kind of subjects do you like for documentaries?. I usually like things that are more political or about something surprising - I recently watched Tell Me Who I Am and Fahrenheit 11/9 and I liked both of those, though I thought 11/9 was pretty biased. There's a documentary called Behind the Curve which is about conspiracy theorists and is pretty fun and surprising. There's also a lot of climate change documentaries, although they can be pretty depressing.. Behind the Curve sounds interesting - can you tell me a little more about it?. It talks about people who think the earth is flat, and how that effects them and their lives as people push them away for seeming crazy.. Oh wow. It's wild how flat earthers are such a big movement!. Also, another horror movie you might like is The Witch, which is a very unique movie set in Puritan times.. I think I might have seen that - is it sometimes written VVitch?. Yeah, it has the weird title.. Okay - I think I'll check out Midsommar. Thanks for the great recommendations!.

I'm thinking about going to the movies this weekend. What are your movie preferences?. I like comedy or adventure action movies. Same here. I have a friend in LA who directs horror/comedies.

What did you like about it and would you want the next movie you see to have a similar story or a different one?. It was typical Stallone with him fighting the drug lords for his daughter. Yes I like movies similar to that.. If you like action, you'd probably like the new Resident Evil re-boot. Would you like to watch it's trailer?. Yes.. Have you seen any of the previous ones?. Not yet. Have you?. Yeah. A lot of them run the same storyline, but the Final Chapter one summarizes them up pretty well and puts a nice bow on the plot.. Ok. Thank you I will check it out.

Yes.I live in North East.snow just started. excepting more in coming days. While I am dealing with the snow I am definately going to be watching movies. How about you? Do you plan to watch some movies?. I used to watch movies. I mostly watch my regional movies... Awesome, tell me about these regional movies, are they mostly about the USA and/or about the East Coast?. No. This is not about the states. This is other country movies.But i used to watch most engish movies in states. ", ". Hello how are you doing today?. I am well and you?. Glad to hear it. I am doing pretty good just surviving this storm we have going on with all this corona virus stuff lol. It actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies I have fallen behind on. I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch?. Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies.. I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!. Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!. Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?. Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.. Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J. Thanks again! Have a good one :).

I just recently rewatched inception because i love christopher nolan, the major actor in it was leonardo dicaprio, another one of my favorites. ", ". Hello. Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me?. Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc.... I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama.. Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.. It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining.. I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it.. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL. I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!. No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split.. I just watched Split recently! I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.. That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for Unbreakable. Honestly, I'm glad Split came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now.. That's so true. I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days. But sometimes, I think movies like Star Wars rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan.. ", ". Hello! I am here to give you some recommendations! How are you today?. I am good.

Okay, I will add this to the list. Do you recommend anything else?. Yes, I selected Mr. Right as well . It's another romantic comedy staring Sam Rockwell and Anna Hendrick. It;s about this crazy, goofy, funny, spy-like couple. A girl fall for the perfect guy, until it turns out hes not so perfect! He's actually a hitman on the run, who has a hit out on himself!

The interesting part to me was seeing how Peter's friends from the first movie play such a large role in helping him as Spiderman, considering that I would usually think of Spiderman as a loner by necessity. It made me think about the character in a different way.. That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner. I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner. Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film. I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion.. You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different. Sure thing!

I have seen several movies lately that I would recommend.. I love movies and would love to hear your recommendations.. If you like mystery/whodunit movies, I would recommend Knives Out. It has a great cast, twist and turns, and a bit of dark comedy.. I did see Knives Out and I definitely enjoyed it. I do enjoy a mystery. I also enjoy horror, drama, and comedy. I watcha lot of movies but some have certainly fallen through the cracks for me.. Glad you enjoyed it too. Wow, so you appreciate many genres! Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler. I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate.. I am aware of that one but have not seen it. I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure.. I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it.. I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it?. Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it.. Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about?. Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them.. I am familiar with them. Judd Hirsh is a very good actor.. Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days! Yes, I am that old!. Ha ha. I'm somewhere in between. I saw it when I was very, very young.. ", ". Hello how are you today?. VERY WELL AND YOU?. I am great thank you! Want to talk about movies?. YES! I AM LOOKING FOR A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE. What are some of your favorite family movies?. WE LIKE DISNEY MOVIES.

Anything interesting or fun?. I am enjoying a movie! Do you enjoy watching movies as well?. Oh, yes, I very much enjoy watching movies.. Excellent! What kind of movies do you tend to watch in your spare time?. I like action/adventure the most. Awesome, I do too.

After being caught, he demands to see Mr. Reacher instead of seeing lawyers. And then begins the twists and turns - something that'll certainly impress you.. Sounds fun.

What type of movies do you like?. I like action and comedy the most. I'm easy because I can like all types.. What is the latest movie you have watched? Both of those genres are awesome... Well I recently watched Equalizer 2...I love all the John Wicks. I'm been wanting to watch the movie Lucy with Scarlet Johanson. n. I haven't seen Equalizer 2, but it sounds very good! Lucy also is on my list of movies to see. What did you like about Equalizer 2?. umm...Denzel is AMAZING :) I like pretty much all the movies he's in.. He is sooooo great!!! One of my favorite actors. yes, I like the movie: Book of Eli, with Denzel. He is very talented. I also like comedies. Like...Internship with Vince Vahn and Owen Wilson. Those two are classic.. Oh, yes! Or Wedding Crashers with Vince Vahn and Owen Wilson as well. Both classics!. haha, yes. now we are on the same page. I also like Alec Baldwin in The Departed with Leo. That movie is great.\\. I highly recommend Vantage Point with Sigourney Weaver and Dennis Quaid. It's action-packed, and it shows the same crime from various perspectives. Putting together the pieces from each character's viewpoint helps the audience to solve the mystery of who committed the crime!. Wow...I just looked it up and it looks really good. I will definitely watch that movie. Thank you for your time and have a great holiday season :). So glad! Hope you get a chance to watch it. It will absolutely be entertaining! Hope you have a great holiday season as well, it was wonderful chatting with you and learning more about your movie preferences!. Yes. It was a pleasure.. :). Mturk is interesting :-p. ", ". Hello!. Hi there!. Do you know what kind of movies do you like?. I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers. I also love horror! I am not a fan of action films or romance much.. What was the last horror movie you watched?. I saw Midsommar in theaters. I didn't think it was scary, more just upsetting, I really liked Hereditary which is from the same director. I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake!. I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic! I think the casting was perfect. oh my gosh YES! I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect. Did you see Get Out or Us? What did you think? I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes. I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me.. Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world.. and her voice?! Holy crap. That and her physical movements. I thought that was such a standout performance. Apparently she didn't tell anyone she was doing the voice like that until they started rolling and the other actors were absolutely terrified.. She is amazing! based on your taste in films, i would recommend A Quiet Place,. Wonderful. I absolutely adored A Quiet Place. The fact that they used a deaf actress and sign language was fantastic. I am heavily involved in the deaf community and know ASL myself, so I was so beyond pleased with the film and authentic representation of the deaf community. I accept!. Amazing, thank you!. Did you see Birdbox? I thought it was pretty well done as well even though it was a similar concept.. I have but i was truly disappointed in the ending. totally. I liked that they used blind people but it was a bit of a cop out ending. I also wanted to know why the crazy people from the mental hospital weren't affected?. It seems like they ran out of ideas and wanted to fill time, a common thread for Netflix films. haha absolutely. I watched tall girl because I knew it would be bad and boy was it. So so cheesy.. ", ". Hello how are you doing? Would you like to pick a movie for Friday evening?. Sure, do you like Tom Cruise? He has a new movie coming out that is a sequel to Top Gun.. Yes Tom Cruise is a terrific actor. I am not entirely sure about the release date for Top Gun 2 but it sounds exciting. Is that the movie you are interested in?. Yes, that is the movie I am interested in. I like action and flying, so I think it could be fun. Should we watch the trailer for Top Gun Maverick? The movie itself doesn't come out until summer.. Yes sounds like a good idea. Especially when you are a big fan of Tom Cruise. You seem to be a fan as well, which of the Mission Impossible movies is your favorite?. I like 4-6. I liked the first three too but they don't compare to the last three ones. What about you?. Same, the newer ones are way more rewatchable and have great stunts too. 1-3 are a bit dated. Well let's watch the Top Gun Maverick trailer and try to figure out how they did these stunts! What do you say?. Sounds great! Let me know if you liked the trailer. It looks so exciting. I think Tom Cruise is a licensed pilot and you can really tell he knows what he's doing up there.. Yeah he does most of movie stunts himself doesn't he? He is very committed to acting. Yeah, did you see in MI: Fallout he broke his ankle and kept going? That is dedication!. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["LOL", "What happened?", "Yeah and the motor cycle chase in all his MI movies.

What is some movies that you have recently seen and enjoyed?. Some of my favorite films are Children of Men and Arrival. I guess I'm into slow science fiction, but I'm fine with any genre as long as the pacing allows me to sit and reflect.. Have you heard of Knowing? It is a really good movie. It takes a little bit to build up to it but it is very exciting. It stars Nicholas Cage.. I have not heard of it. What's it about?. It is about a man that comes across a letter from the past and starts putting together that it foretells future disasters. He finds out the world will end soon but no one listens until its too late.. Oh, that sounds absolutely fascinating. Have any other films in that vein?. Nope it is the only one. It came out in 2009. You got it. What do you like most about it?. I like the suspense and the uncertainty.. That sounds awesome. You have a trailer you can send me?. ", ". Hi! I will be helping you with finding a movie you will love today!. Great. I enjoy action movies. I also enjoy drama and maybe a little romance.. What's your opinion on movies about race cars?. They are ok, I guess. I don't seek them out on purpose. Not really my favorite.. How about martial arts?. Oh, yes. I do enjoy martial arts movies. I appreciate when there is a little culture or history involved in a movie.. I would recommend watching The Karate Kid if you haven't seen it yet! The 1984 version of the movie.. I have. I tend to shy away from remakes. I sometimes feel it is degrading to the integrity of the original.. Yeah, I don't think the remake was done well at all.. I enjoyed the Kill Bill series. It had the perfect ammount of fantasy.. Have you seen Jason Bourne?. Is that new? I have seem many of the Bourne movies but I can't keep track of them all.. No it is from 2016. I am not sure if I have seen it. I like some sci fi too. Any suggestions in that genre?. ", ". Hey how's it going. Hey, good.. Any interesting movies you see lately?. Some recent movies I saw and liked were Knives Out, Uncut Gems and Contagion. I generally like movies with deep characters, an engaging plot and beautiful cinematography.. Oh wow, I've heard Uncut Gems was really good. Whats you'r favorite part about it? (without giving spoilers?). I loved the uneasy feeling that the filmmakers were trying to create. It was also probably the best performance of Adam Sandler's career.. So are you really into horror that relies more on the psychological aspect rather than jump scares?. Yeah, definitely.. Can you name another one in that category you're a fan of?.

I've never been a fan of child's play, but my sister wanted me to watch this one...the best one out of them all...there were a few funny parts where chucky (now named buddi) would repeat what was said, explicit stuff, but funny coming from a doll and the way he would say it.

I am into funny movies also, which is why I am suggesting maybe seeing a different genre. I have been to the movies recently and the comedy movie selection is poor.

How much do you know about Pearl Harbor?. thanks for the help... that could b e a good option... any other recommendations?. I would recommend seeing Midway if you are into action/war movies. The movie does a great job at illustrating the attack on our country and Pearl Harbor. The actors in the movie are amazing as well. Perfect movie for a night out.. ok I think that sounds great... what is your favorite movie ever?. My favorite movie ever is Saving Private Ryan. Midway is very much like this movie.. ok great I love that movies as well. I accept your recommendation to see Midway.. Awesome. What is your favorite movie of all time?. for sound engineering I loved Fury... though a bit too violent... I also loved Inglorious Basterds but that was not really historically accurate ;-). Inglorious Basterds is a great movie as well. Have you ever seen American Sniper?. yes it was pretty awesome Bradley Cooper was great. Bradley Cooper did a great job playing the role of Chris Kyle. It is amazing to me how many tours in Iraq Chris did and the danger he faced, only to be killed by one of his own men domestically.. yes that was sad... anyways thanks for the chat I am looking forward to seeing midway!.

I am here to try to find a movie trailer that you would like to view. Are you ready?. Hello! I am well, thanks! I am ready!. First off, what is your favorite kind of movie to watch - drama, action, comedy, etc?. I definitely don't care a lot for drama. I would say horror/thriller, action, and comedy are probably my favorite genres.. Those are my favorites too! Have you seen the latest Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise?. I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list.. I would have to agree with you on this. I think half of the movie was chase scenes of one sort or another.. It can be fun, but bot when it takes up most of the movie.. Have you seen any of the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise? While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot.. I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting.. You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!. Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?. The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!. Thanks for that information. I am definitely interested in this and accept your recommendation.. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together.. Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see?. We both like action movies :). Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ?. The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little.... Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. Yes, a similar one please :). I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead.. We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it?. okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray. Yes please :). Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties.. Of course :). while I'm waiting I want to see what other movies especially comedy do yall like?. We saw the sequel to Zombieland recently! I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it! Especially the midcredit scene :P. I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first.. I think if Zombieland: Double Tap came out first, though, It would be the favorite... Like if the movies were to flip dates our opinions would be different.. It sounds like they would be if they were. I'm going to attempt to send the movie trailer again.. Okay cool. I try not to have high hopes with sequels just as I try to separate books from their movies and pretend they are both their own thing.. They definitely leave a lot out in the movies compared to some books.. Any luck with the link?. I can't get birds of prey, I can get warm bodies, ouija, and the duff. Ooh, I've always wanted to see warm bodies!. ", ". Hello. Hello :-). I understand that you are looking for movie recommandations?. I am. What kind of movies do you like?.

I want an action movie. A recent action film that was very good is Avengers: Endgame. It was action packed and emotional and rated PG-13, so it's appropriate for most kids.

It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm.. Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film Oh Lucy with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films..

Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?. My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard.. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.. The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated?. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.. Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions?. Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore. I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train.. Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise. That sounds cool. What is that about?. It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him. It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists. Definitely sounds cool. I will definitely take a look. Sounds great!

I like to watch older movies. any monty python movies or lethal weapon movies are great. Love Lethal Weapon flicks! Only saw Monty Python and Holy Grail but loved it!. They are classics. I saw naked gun for the first time in a while the other night. Also saw Scarface for the first time last week. What movies have you seen recently?. Both excellent flicks but vastly different haha! I love older flicks as well. Saw three Oclock High and Doctor Sleep! Both solid flicks!. I have never seen those ones, I got to check them out. What do you like about those movies?. One is classic 80s comedy, the other was a solid sequel to the Shining! Very well made and I am a sucker for Horror! Well. Gotchu, I gotta check those out but I should watch The Shining first. I surprisingly have never seen it although I always hear about it. I love horror as well. Have you seen Amityville horror?. Not in a long time!!! I would like to watch that! Not sure how to do it but I accept that recommendation haha!!. Haha sounds good. I see you like older movies and you have seen alot of the classics ive mentioned. I am going to watch some trailers on the two movies tyouve said youve seen recently. How often you watc movies?. Sadly almost every night! Ive seen alot of garbage haha I enjoy watching B movies because they are funny because they are so bad. Watch Bad Ben on Amazon for a chuckle! Found footage horror but so cheap and bad! Hysterical. I enjoy movies but cant watch them too often because I have short attention span haha. I like classics because I feel like the newer movies arent as well made and there are alot of remakes out. What are your favorite classics?. Rear Window is my favorite! Classic Hitchcock. Most brilliant film I have ever seen. It was the first time I saw subtext painted by camerawork and could see the story he was painting underneath the main story. Amazing.. You have me convinced on that one I gotta check it out. You have most likely seen Adam Sandler classics. Have you seen Little Nicky?. Yes, and I will never see that one again haha! I am going to reject that one haha and accept Amittyville Horror. Sounds good!. One more thing! You should Check out Psycho if you can! Nearly as brilliant as Rear Window and super influential on horror!. ", ". Hello, how are you doing tonight?. good how are you. I am doing well.. im am looking for a movie with drama. Have you seen the movie A Fall from Grace?. i have not, but have heard mixed reviews. ", ". Hey there, how are you?. not bad and you?.

What's the last movie you watched, and did you actually enjoy it?. The last movie I watched was Zombieland.

I just had to re-watch Polar all over again last week. I didn't see that one yet but Jonas Akerlund directed that and I love his work. He also makes great music videos.. Yeah, he is a great director. I loved his Lords of chaos as well. SO movie that reminds me somewhat of Polar (what I've heard of it) that I thought was excellant is Atomic Blonde, starring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy. It takes place in Berlin during the cold war revolving around double agents. It's great. Great action scenes, intriguing story line, great music seleciton and cinematography.

Anything with Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd or any other comedian that's really ironic. I really enjoy movies where there is a huge misunderstanding that kind of spirals out of control. Kind of like Pineapple Express or Burn After Reading. Have you seen Burn After Reading?. Yes I have, and I enjoyed it. Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd are also some of my favorite comedians, along with Jason Bateman. Have you seen any of his movies?. Yes, I really like Horrible Bosses!. A great movie! Definitely one of those movies that quickly spirals out of control.. Absolutely, most Jason Bateman movies do kind of like Game Night.. Would you be interested in a similar movie or something different?. Something similar would be awesome.. Have you seen Jay and Silent Bob Reboot?. I have not. Would I have to see the first movie to understand this one?. No, and that's the beauty of it. It practically follows the original films plot line.. I'll have to check it out.

I really liked the first one, I haven't gotten around to seeing the second one yet! Was there anything you disliked?. I can't recall any parts that i disliked actually. You should check it out especially if you have small children.. How rare is that! I'll definitely have to check it out then! I'm a huge fan of Disney myself :).

Based off of three women who have husbands in Irish mafia. Such a great film also. Do you know of any other movies similar to that?. That sounds really good! If you like movies about women and crime, you might like Widows! It's set in contemporary Chicago. Four women are left with their husband's massive debt after they all mysteriously die from criminal activities. They have to take matters into their own hands and do things on their own terms! Would you be interested in that?. Yes! That sounds really good! Thank you! I accept your recommendation!. I really like a lot of different crime movies like that and women empowerment!. I love a movie with a strong female lead for sure. Any other recommendations?. Hmm, I would say that the movie Hustlers may also interest you! It depicts a band of women that scheme and trick Wall Street men out of money! It has a lot of big name stars including J-Lo, Lizzo, Cardi B and Lili Reinhart!. Oh wow, Cardi B in a movie haha! I'll check that one out too!. I know, right? It also has KeKe Palmer and Julia Stiles as well. But based upon your interest in The Kitchen, I think Widows might be the most similar! Personally, I just love watching downtrodden women taking their lives back, to be honest. So often women are forced to be in submissive roles, so it's cool to see women kicking butt!. Yes! I completely agree! I loved your recommendations and I will most certainly check them out! Thank you!. ", ". Hello, how are you doing today?. I'm just fine thanks for asking.

No, me either, my aunt used to live with me and I wouldn't even let her watch scary movies in my house!!. Yes, even seeing little snipit can give me bad dreams for a week! When it comes to comedies, do you enjoy those that have a romantic side?. Yes, definitely a romantic side, one of my all time favorites is Four Weddings and a Funeral.. I have never seen that one but have seen it listed on Netflix and things like that. One of my favorites that reminds me of that is Maid of Honor and Bridesmaids! Have you seen either?. Oh yes, I love Bridesmaids, Kristen Wigg is the best!!. Yes, she is hilarious. Have you seen any really good movies in the theatre lately?. To be honest, I really have not! I have been really into the holiday movies on hallmark channel though!. OMG!!! HAAHA I secretly/not so secretly love Hallmark movies!. Same here oh my gosh! Totally random but have you seen wedding crashers... highly recommend!. Yes, I have actually seen wedding crashers and loved it!. Me too, probably too many times but hey so funny, and cute actually. Back to the holiday movies, have you seen the movies with the girl from Mean Girls (Gretchen Weiners)? So funny to see her again!. I'm not familiar with her, but that's because I don't believe I ever saw Mean Girls? What else has she been in?. Only thing I remember her from was Mean Girls, kinda funny, that movie is pretty funny too you should try that one out, a little older but still kind of a classic. What about Just Friends, that is a funny holiday romcom too!. Tell me more about Just Friends, I'm kind of in the holiday spirit movie mood:). ", ". Hello there, how are you doing?. I am doing well, and you?. i'm doing good, thank you. i would like to know your favorite movie genres and actors.

Okay. Have you seen the new trailer for Rise of Skywalker yet?. Yes I do not like that movie sadly. How about a good Sci Fi movie in general?. Did you see Terminator Dark Fate?. Yes I didn't like the fact they killed John Carter in the first 5 min of the movie. How about something about Predator that is recent.. The Predator was the most recent release they had out. Do you like anime sci fi? Alita Battle Angel was a pretty interesting movie.. Yes I loved Alita Battle Angel, I am excited they are bringing out a sequel.. I can't wait to see that myself. I really enjoyed the first one even though the reviews didn't seem so great.. I think there was Bias due to Capt Marvel SJW flack. I think I will watch The Predator thank you!. You're welcome. I hope you like it.. How about a Current comedy something like The Hangover.. Do you like animated films?. I love animated films like Akira. So would you like something like Frozen 2? It's a kids film but it does have adult humor in it. The little snowman in it is quite hilarious.. I think I would prefer something along the lines of Japanese animated films. They are more adult and care more for the story then politics.. I see. Have you seen the new Men in Black International movie that came out recently. There's comedy and sci-fi for you.. Yes didn't like it. I want a Japanese animated film to watch.. How about Ghost in the Machine with Scarlett Johansson. Have you seen that one?. Yes it was wonderful but it's not what I asked for. I want a Anime film in English.. I'm apologize. I believe that movie is in English. Let me see if I can find something else for you.. I am done thank you.. ", ".

I'm looking for a movie to watch, can you recommend a trailer?. Yes! Are you looking for a movie in theaters or one you can watch online?. In theaters sounds good!. Great!

Ooh, I haven't heard of that! I like satire, that sounds like a good one.. Yes, I highly recommend it. It has just the right amount of humor. Rebel Wilson is even in it!. No way!

Truthfully I am a documentary fan. Just a splash of sci-fi or horror. Midsommar to be was more of a really unusual acid trip (lol!) than a horror IMO.. lol i can recommend some documentaries. what kind do you like to watch?. History. Pirates. Tales of the ocean/boating/island life.. ok. i have a movie to recommend. how about pirates of the carribbean.. I've seen all of those and the one with Keith Richards was my favorite.. ok. do you want me to recommend that or something else..

Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly.. yes! I've seen Black Swan and Mother! Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling. I definitely suggest Pi then.

And of course, the droids.. Do you think you would enjoy a more serious film or one with comedic moments?. I prefer serious over trash humor, if that makes sense. I don't like movies with crass humor. I like good stories. Yeah, I agree. I really enjoy the Star Wars films, and I'm always on the lookout to find similar movies. I enjoy the action-adventure type movies with a healthy mix of a good story with appropriate humor.. As long as there's no severe violence I'm good!

You have me convinced on that one I gotta check it out. You have most likely seen Adam Sandler classics. Have you seen Little Nicky?. Yes, and I will never see that one again haha! I am going to reject that one haha and accept Amittyville Horror. Sounds good!. One more thing! You should Check out Psycho if you can!

I have not seen Irishman, but I'm a fan of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I'll have to check that out. Would you refer a movie that's on netflix?. Sure if you want. I also like foreign language comedy films. Foreign Language. Well, I would recommend High Tension. It's a horror film, so a little bit of me, and a little bit of you.. Okay, well thanks. I dislike horror films, can you recommend anything else?. Sure. Have you seen Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. It's a 1988 film staring Antonia Banderas. Its about a series of heightened womanly dilemmas, with a little bit of sexual politics added in. That sounds great. I haven't seen it. I will check it out.. Something a little more light hearted is Klown its a 2012 film with a little bit of HBO's Curb your Enthusiasm added in.. Okay, cool. I like Curb Your Enthusiasm. I'll check it out, thanks!. And if you are looking for something that can pull at your heart strings, I would also recommend My Life as a Dog, from Sweden. Its a coming of age movie, very thought provoking. It goes into childhood wonder and how we have to realize the inevitable as we grow up, such as how to deal with death and heartache.. Oh, cool, I heard that is good. Have you seen Babylon Berlin on Netflix? I thought it was pretty good. It's about crime in Weimar Germany. It's in my queue, actually. Thank you for the recommendation! I'll have to watch that!. Yeah, I thought the design and costumes were really good. Apparently it was one of the most expensive Netflix films ever to produce. Seriously!? Wow! I just finished the Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, oh my goodness, grab tissues if you want to watch that.. That sounds interesting as well. That was such a crazy story.

I usually lean towards comedies and dramas. I don't like science fiction or action. I can do a thriller if it's intelligent.. ", ". Hi, how can I help you?. Yes, i was looking for movie recommendations, do you have any?. Yes, what was the last movie that you saw? My personal favorite is La La Land, because it is both a drama and comedy.. The last movie i saw was Geronimo, i enjoyed it because of the action and drama. What is La La Land about?. La La Land is about Ryan Gosling playing a struggling jazz musician who falls in love with Emma Stone who's a barista aspiring to become an actress. It's a musical as well, so there's a lot of singing.. I see, sounds interesting, but for me i enjoy movies more centered around action, do you have any reccomendations. Yes, Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best action movie I've seen thus far. You cannot go wrong with Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane and chasing after bad guys.. Wow, i definitely find that interesting, what is the plot about? How is Tom Cruise's acting in that movie compared to others?. Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol. Fallout is interesting because it shows Tom Cruise as an older man who is still trying to keep up with the action of chasing bad guys.. That sound's like a fantastic movie, i will definitely will check it out sometime! Thank you very much for that recommendation!. No problem. Hope you enjoy it!. I will, by chance do you know of any other movies that involve drama?. Yes, there's quite a few. If you want drama and action, I would recommend the Jason Bourne series.

When the U.S.S.R. breaks up, the government tries to kill her as the action moves to present-day New York, where she is a freelance operative. who is starring in the movie?.

And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please.. Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true.. So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level.. She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc.... Cool--sounds interesting. I'd love to watch it. I accept your recommendation!. ", ". Hi, how are you?.

", ". Hi, how can I help you?. Yes, i was looking for movie recommendations, do you have any?. Yes, what was the last movie that you saw? My personal favorite is La La Land, because it is both a drama and comedy.. The last movie i saw was Geronimo, i enjoyed it because of the action and drama. What is La La Land about?. La La Land is about Ryan Gosling playing a struggling jazz musician who falls in love with Emma Stone who's a barista aspiring to become an actress. It's a musical as well, so there's a lot of singing.. I see, sounds interesting, but for me i enjoy movies more centered around action, do you have any reccomendations. Yes, Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best action movie I've seen thus far. You cannot go wrong with Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane and chasing after bad guys.. Wow, i definitely find that interesting, what is the plot about? How is Tom Cruise's acting in that movie compared to others?. Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol. Fallout is interesting because it shows Tom Cruise as an older man who is still trying to keep up with the action of chasing bad guys.. That sound's like a fantastic movie, i will definitely will check it out sometime! Thank you very much for that recommendation!. No problem. Hope you enjoy it!. I will, by chance do you know of any other movies that involve drama?. Yes, there's quite a few. If you want drama and action, I would recommend the Jason Bourne series. Matt Damon does a good job of balancing both the action and drama as he finds out about his past.. What other notable actor's and actress's are on the Jason Bourne Series?. There's Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and instead of Matt Damon the fourth movie in the series The Bourne Legacy stars Jeremy Renner.. That is pretty awesome, is enjoy movies like that. I mainly watch movies about Native Americans, do you know of any movies similar to something like that?. Yes, Dances with Wolves is a good one. I watched it a long time back, but I recall the story was quite interesting. It's about an Army officer who runs into a band of Native Americans after his stint in the army.. I have heard of that, that sounds around more of my taste in movies, i will check that out recommendation! Do you know of any other similar movies?. Yes, there's also Last of the Mohicans, which is based on a popular book. It's about a frontiersman who learns to live with the Native Americans.. I have seen that movie, it is interesting because of the conflict between the Native Americans and European's.. ", ". Hello, My name is Danny.. Hi! My name is Erin.. What kind of movies do you like?. My favorite type of movie is mystery. I like where there is a big twist at the end. I also love ones if they are based off of books. Gone Girl is one example I really like. Do you have any recommendations in this genre?. I'm not sure I have a good movie that could catch your interest, but right now on TV I'm watching a show call The Stranger that perfectly fit what you like.. Actually my mom just recommended that to me! Harlan Coban wrote that book and he is one of my favorite authors.. It's really good. I'm sure it has all the things you look for and it has so many twists that you stay engaged all the time.. Ok great! I will try it!. Perfect. I'm sure you'll like it.. Thank you so much for the recommendation! I'm looking forward to watching it!. It does not show on the selection of movies that I'm suppouse to look. My second favorite genre of movies is romantic comedies.. do you have an recommendations for that?. Yes, but I'm sure you have al ready seen it. What is it?. Love Actually :-). I actually haven't seen it! I've always heard about it though. Why do you recommend that one?. It's really funny all the way through and has a lot of romantic moments that will make you cry and laugh.. Ok great! I'll have to check if it is on Netflix!. Yes, try it there. if not I'm sure you can find it at Walmart or Target for really cheap. Ok great thanks!.

For horror, do you enjoy scares or a more suspenseful ride throughout the film?. Suspenseful rides are better.. Are you a fan of The Others or Silence of the Lambs?. I haven't seen The Others, but yes I love Silence of the Lambs.. Cool. For horror, I would recommend the movie The Witch starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Hereditary starring Toni Collette.. I haven't heard of that one, so I will give it a shot!. For sci-fi, Ex Machina starring Oscar Isaac(Poe from Star Wars) is probably one of the best in recent years. I have been considering watching that one for a while, I'll have to give it a shot if you are recommending it.. Great movie about robot singularity. What are your favorite fantasy movies?. I have a wide taste when it comes to fantasy: Willow, the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Clash of the Titans, Lady Hawk, Highlander, Sleepy Hollow, all of the Lord of the Rings movies and spin offs of course.. Not to familiar with fantasy, but I absolutely loved Pan's Labyrinth. I'll jot down those movies to watch soon.. Pan's Labyrinth was pretty awesome!. ", ". Hello, how are you doing today?. I'm just fine thanks for asking. That's good, how can I help you today? What is your movie preference?. I like anything with action, drama, or adventure. Know of any movies that fit into these genres?. Actually, yes! I know lots of movies with this criteria. Give me an example of your favorite movie that meets these requirements.. Fast and Furious Movies, 300, 13 Hours: Soldiers of Benghazi, John Wick, etc. Okay, that gives me a good idea of what you are looking for. John Wick was a great movie. Now if you could tell me an example of a movie that you didn't like or care for?. I really didn't care for Blade Runner, it was too dull. Some of the new Star Wars movies are a bit complex for my taste. I want something that's mindless and can take me out of the real world for a while.. That gives me a great idea of what your taste is... Have you been to the movie theater lately?. It's been a month or two. Did you see all the Marvell Avengers? If so already, tell me how you feel about terminator.. I have seen the Avengers. Not so interested in Terminator. Have you seen the preview to the new bad boys movie coming out next month?. No i haven't, is it good?. It might be a little comedic for you taste, but it should be a good movie. But I think you should definitely check out Bloodshot. Have you heard of it? I really think it's up your alley.. I have not heard of it, what is it about?. ", ". Hello! Can I help you find a movie?. Please! I'm a huge fan of horror films, but prefer more dread than gore. Do you have any suggestions?. What is your favorite horror film?. My favorite horror film would probably be The Shining. It's a unique story that keeps the viewer on edge the entire time. I love that over jump scares and senseless gore.. Ok, awesome. Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer?. Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already.. It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best.. Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as Hitchcock-ian?. I will do my best to find something you haven't seen!. Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film!. How did you feel about Split from M. Night? Did you find it too slow, or did that have the dread you're looking for?. I actually haven't seen that one yet. I also did not know Night made that one. Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about?. It's one of my favorites he's done so far. James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film.. 23 personalities! That sounds interesting. Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film? He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a bad guy before.. He's *mostly* the bad guy. The film is about a group of girls that are abducted and held hostage by a person with multiple personalities. One personality in particular - The Beast - has a plan for them. Some of the personalities side with The Beast, and some do not. It is the second film in the Unbreakable series, but different in style for sure. You don't need to know anything about Unbreakable to see Split, though.. Wow! That sounds like a psychological mind twist and definitely vintage Shyamalan. I will accept the recommendation and give it a watch! It sounds like it's right up my alley and deals more with dread and suspense. Thank you kindly!. You're welcome!.

I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up.. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary.. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?. This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright.. I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different?.

I have never heard of the devil. Do you have any details about the movie?. So the movie is about a group of people where they all have a secret past.

What genre is your go to when seeking out new movies?. horror is my favorite genre. What was the last horror movie you saw?. The last one I saw in the theater was It: Chapter 2. I've watched some older ones at home more recently.. ", ". Hi! I have seen several movies lately that I would recommend.. I love movies and would love to hear your recommendations.. If you like mystery/whodunit movies, I would recommend Knives Out. It has a great cast, twist and turns, and a bit of dark comedy.. I did see Knives Out and I definitely enjoyed it. I do enjoy a mystery. I also enjoy horror, drama, and comedy. I watcha lot of movies but some have certainly fallen through the cracks for me.. Glad you enjoyed it too. Wow, so you appreciate many genres! Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler. I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate.. I am aware of that one but have not seen it. I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure.. I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it.. I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it?. Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it.. Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about?. Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them.. I am familiar with them. Judd Hirsh is a very good actor.. Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days! Yes, I am that old!. Ha ha. I'm somewhere in between. I saw it when I was very, very young.. Well i hope you take me up on my recommendation and see Uncut Gems, if only to see Sandler's amazing performance.. You have convinced me. I would like to see it now and am sure I will soon.. Great! Enjoy the rest of your day!. Thank you. I would definitely like to see the trailer for Uncut Gems.. ", ". Hi. How is everything today?. Everything is going well, thanks! How are you?. I'm doing great today. Thanks. That is wonderful. I think it's a perfect day to see a good movie.. What genre of movies do you like?. I really enjoy movies with clever comedy (as opposed to cheap comedy), dramas, documentaries, and movies that make you think.. Do you have a favorite actor for this types of movies?. Kate Winslet is a personal favorite. I also love Meryl Streep.. I have a movie that I think you will like its called Divergent.. Oh that sounds very interesting. I'd love to hear more.. Its a movie in a futuristic world were Kate Winslet's character must decide which faction she wants to join in order to survive.. I do believe that would be a fascinating watch!. Yes it is. I highly recommend!!. I would love to see it. I love to watch Kate Winslet - she is such a talent!. She is awesome. I will get that trailer for you if you want.. Yes, please! Thanks so much for your thoughtful recommendation.. You're very welcome!! It was nice chatting with you today.. Likewise! It was my pleasure..

I loved it too! So the director Ari Aster, are you familiar with him? Curious if you've seen Hereditary?. Yes.... for me that was horror movie of the year for 2018. haha that's awesome.

This past weekend I watched Ford vs Ferrari and I thought it was good.. Oh great! What an all-star cast that movie has. What were some aspects of the movie that you liked most?. I liked that was about actual events, had humor, and was exciting during the racing events. It was a drama, but thrilling.. Do you usually prefer movies that are about actual events? I love movies that have humor even if it's not an actual comedy. Humor is so necessary!. Not necessarily do I prefer movies about actual events. I just find them interesting. I like movies that have a good message and I can watch with my family. Okay awesome! So you prefer movies that can be watched with the whole family?. yes, definitely!. Are you and your family more engaged by fantasy/adventure films or more documentary style films?. I would say fantasy/adventure...especially to keep my young boys interest. Okay perfect! I think I have just the movie for you and the boys!. Please tell me what you recommend. The newest Avengers movie, Avengers: Endgame is a great family friendly movie. It will hold the attention of your younger children while still providing some subtle adult humor. It also provides a good message about working together as a team. The soundtrack is super catchy as well!. I would agree, but we have already seen that movie. You are on the right track though. The whole family did enjoy that movie.. Oh shoot!

Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the Holocuast. The documentary is called Shoah.. That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary?. A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians.. That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation!. Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing.. That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries?. No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste.. That's too bad. I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans. But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like.. Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences. It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and Shoah consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time.. I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is Hoop Dreams, have you seen that?. Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash.. I did enjoy the Biggest Short. I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet. John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though.. ", ". Good afternoon. I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer.. hi can you recommend a action movie?.

Have you seen any good movies lately?. I think so. What kind of movies do you like?. I like documentaries, films that reallly offer up a unique worldview and new perspective on things. The more out there and interesting the better.. What is a documentary that you have watched recently that you enjoyed?. I saw one called Fantastic Fungi all about mushrooms, mould, and spores. I also like films that focus on the arts.. What did you like about them?. I liked it because it enlightened me about things in the natural world that I already did not know. I like learning more about nature and the world around me. Then I can hopefully apply it to my daily life and life a more fulfilled and interesting experience.. Have you watched any more from the director of Louis Schwartzberg?. No, I don't think so. What kinds of films has he directed?. He has done several called Moving Art: Forests, Oceans, Waterfalls. Wings of Life. Mysteries of the Unseen. Cool! I have never heard of those before. What one did you like best?. Mysteries of the Unseen. What exactly is the plot or subject matter surrounding that one?. There are many things around us that we can't see, an unseen world. It's a very beautiful and interesting film about thins you don't even know existed (well me.). Really awesome, something that I really enjoy and can appreciate. I will certainly look it up and I will accept your recommendation to view this film. Thanks again!. ", ". Hi! See any movies lately?. HI!! I have, I just saw Dolittle. Have you seen it?. No, but I know what it's about! I love Robert Downey Jr. Did you see it for him?. No, I love him though. My kids wanted to see it, so I took them. What kind of movies are you interested in?. I like animated movies a lot, sort of like what your kids might watch! Do you ever take them to see animated ones?. We do go to the movies a lot, and of course animated ones are their favorite. I think next up on our list might be Sonic The HedgeHog. Have you seen that one?. No, but I heard kids love it! They fixed Sonic's face, he use to be super scary to kids! Now he looks like the actual character!. Well thats good, haha! I think they will love it. I need a movie for my husband and I to go see, with no kids. Any good recommendations?. Really depends, are you looking for a date movie, or maybe more of just a night-on-the-town movie?. Well my husband isn't a fan of any sappy movies. He likes action/suspense movies. So maybe something along the lines would be great?. ", ". Hello, Are you interested in Movies?. yes i am! you are as well?. I am! What are your favorite type of Movies?. I like historical, and horror movies. Ok. I do too! what was the latest movie you watched?. I watched back to the future, part 2, yesterday. Love that Movie. Michael J Fox is in it..

Hello how are you doing today?. I am well and you?. Glad to hear it. I am doing pretty good just surviving this storm we have going on with all this corona virus stuff lol. It actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies I have fallen behind on. I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch?. Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies.. I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!.

I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!. Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?. Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.. Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J. Thanks again! Have a good one :). ", ". Hello there.. Hi. ", ". Hi. I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer.. yes that would be great!. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. something funny. What's the last movie that you watched?.

It's about a detective who is investigating a missing patient at an asylum on an island. That sounds good...right up my alley. Not too many blood and guts?. No, definitely not. There's very little of that. Like, you see some guy get beat up a bit for one scene, but for the most part it's all about the story and dialogue. It's a great movie.. That sounds great. I actually think I'll watch it tonight!! Thanks for the suggestion!. You're welcome.. Have a great night!! Any other suggestions before I go?. No, not really. But Shutter Island is also a bit older.

Good Morning, How are things going with you today?. good how are you?. Doing great. Watched a lot of great movies this weekend. Which ones are some of your favorites?. I am into funny movies... do you have any suggestions of trailers to check out so I can go to the movies next week?. I am into funny movies also, which is why I am suggesting maybe seeing a different genre. I have been to the movies recently and the comedy movie selection is poor. I would not want to see you waste your money. What about action movies?. ok I would go see an action film. I am also really into war movies that depict American History. How much do you know about Pearl Harbor?. thanks for the help... that could b e a good option... any other recommendations?. I would recommend seeing Midway if you are into action/war movies. The movie does a great job at illustrating the attack on our country and Pearl Harbor. The actors in the movie are amazing as well. Perfect movie for a night out.. ok I think that sounds great... what is your favorite movie ever?. My favorite movie ever is Saving Private Ryan. Midway is very much like this movie.. ok great I love that movies as well. I accept your recommendation to see Midway.. Awesome. What is your favorite movie of all time?. for sound engineering I loved Fury... though a bit too violent... I also loved Inglorious Basterds but that was not really historically accurate ;-). Inglorious Basterds is a great movie as well. Have you ever seen American Sniper?. yes it was pretty awesome Bradley Cooper was great. Bradley Cooper did a great job playing the role of Chris Kyle. It is amazing to me how many tours in Iraq Chris did and the danger he faced, only to be killed by one of his own men domestically.. yes that was sad... anyways thanks for the chat I am looking forward to seeing midway!. ", ". Hey! How are you doing today?. I am doing great .. Nice! Looking for some good movie recommendations?. Yes I am.. Well you have come to the right place.

Are there any xmas horror or action movies that you have seen in the past that you really liked?. Yes. Hobbes&Shaw, Krampus, a Christmas Nightmare, and Silent Night Deadly Night.. Nice! Krampus and Christmas Nightmare are some of my favorites.A nightmare before Christmas is a solid Disney classic if you have never seen it. If you want scarier (that's not animated), go for Jack Frost. For action (and christmas) If you haven't seen Die Hard (there is also a second one), you should for sure start there.

That is also a dark comedy about a dysfunctional family.. Yes I have.. Did you like it? Would you enjoy a similar film?. I like this recommendation. Yes, I would enjoy a similar film..

The trailers are really good, but it does help to be a fan and know about the last few movies. Make sure you catch it.. I think the only Daniel Craig James Bond that I've seen was casino royale. There was an older one I saw a very long time ago with a ski lodge? but the memory is very fuzzy. Which Daniel Craig Bond films should I see before I watch the latest one?. Well, I would suggest at least the last one, which is Spectre. What other type of movies do you enjoy?. A pretty wide variety if I'm being honest. I tend to lean towards action films; like Pacific Rim and Mad Max: Fury Road. Honestly if a movie involves a pretty woman controlling a big machine, I'll probably love it. Do you have any recommendations?. Haha. I tend to go that way too. I am also a huge Star wars fan. You'll definitely enjoy the new James Bond, action and story.. Okay, I accept your recommendation. Thank you!. Enjoy, and I'm sure you'll check out the new Black Widow movie.. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Marvel. I think I'm a bit burned out. I did like the most recent Thor movie though.

What was the latest movie that you saw and liked?. I watched Us recently and I liked that a lot. Us is a great movie! Do you like horror movies in general?. It depends - I don't like horror movies that are just gore or things jumping out, but I like movies that are suspenseful and keep you guessing. Have you seen any Ari Aster movies? They're pretty scary and suspenseful.. I've never heard of them - what are some of their movies?. Midsommer and Hereditary, one is about a couple going to Sweden and finding a cult, and one is about a family haunted by demons.. Oh okay! I've seen Hereditary and I've heard about Midsommer but I wasn't sure if I would like it - it seemed to get mixed reviews. It's weird but visually really beautiful and worth watching.. okay cool I'll maybe check it out! Do you have any other recommendations? I also like documentaries. ", ". Hi there. Hello. Do you have a recommendation?. What types of movies do you like?. I enjoy comedies and thrillers.. Oh nice! I've always loved Nightmare on Elm Street as a thriller. I have never seen that actually. I am a HUGE Stephen King fan!. Nice! Have you ever seen It?. I have not. It has been on my too watch list for awhile. I really like campy movies that are super predictable. Those 80's slasher, horror type films.. Gotcha, I'd definitely recommend it!. I will take you up on that recommendation!. You may enjoy The Shining. I LOVE THAT MOVIE!. Awesome! Both that and Psycho are classics. Psycho is fantastic! Have you ever seen Rear Window?. I actually haven't! What's it about?. Its about a man who is injured and in a wheelchair and all he can do is watch the couryard in his apartment complex all day. He hears gunshots and sees someone commit a murder.

Split is based on the idea that a man kidnaps three girls, but the kicker is that he has 23 unique personalities. And apparently there is a 24th personality that is really horrible that has yet to come out yet. So the girls try to escape before the 24th comes out.. Oh wow! That sounds creepy and definitely thrilling. What about Glass?. Its the sequel to Split, and focuses on the 24th personality being used as a weapon..

I just rewatched one of his older movies the other day and he looks like a baby compared to now. amazing changes but fits him perfect even better. oh most definitely. seems like dwayne johnson and kevin hart are a pretty good working combo though. kevin hart is something different but when i see them act together they really match in comedy compering to others u see them mix with rolls. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Great! What type of movies would you recommend?. Well there are many different types, what type of movie trailers would you normally like to see?. I love movies with a good story. I don't like horror or bloody movies. I enjoy comedies, dramas, and indies.. Okay, what was the last movie you watched that you enjoyed?. I really enjoyed The Green Book. Such a good friendship story.. Do you want to see a smiliar move to The Green Book, or something different?. I am open to seeing almost anything that isn't grusome.. One of my favorite movies is Forrest Gump, it is similar to The Green Book and won 6 Oscars!. I do love that movie. Do you have any suggestions of a more recent movie?. Bohemian Rhapsody is a recent move that is also criticallly acclaimed.. That sounds good.I also enjoy biographies. Do you have any other movies that you would also recommend?. Since you like biographical films, I watched the Imitation Game and it was an engaging story, with a very good cast.. That sounds perfect! I do remember that the star was up for an Oscar?. Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch was nominated for an Oscar for his role in the movie but did not win.. It sounds like something I would love to see. Do you have any other favorites that you have watched?. One film which I don't see discussed often that I love is Whiplash, with J.K. Simmons. It tells the story of a Jazz student and his teacher, and their toxic relationship.. I have not heard of it. It sounds interesting. I appreciate your insight!. ", ". hello!. hello. what kinds of movies do you like?. I like movies that make you think.

Have you seen any Ari Aster movies? They're pretty scary and suspenseful.. I've never heard of them - what are some of their movies?. Midsommer and Hereditary, one is about a couple going to Sweden and finding a cult, and one is about a family haunted by demons.. Oh okay! I've seen Hereditary and I've heard about Midsommer but I wasn't sure if I would like it - it seemed to get mixed reviews.

I usually like things that are more political or about something surprising - I recently watched Tell Me Who I Am and Fahrenheit 11/9 and I liked both of those, though I thought 11/9 was pretty biased. There's a documentary called Behind the Curve which is about conspiracy theorists and is pretty fun and surprising. There's also a lot of climate change documentaries, although they can be pretty depressing.. Behind the Curve sounds interesting - can you tell me a little more about it?. It talks about people who think the earth is flat, and how that effects them and their lives as people push them away for seeming crazy.. Oh wow. It's wild how flat earthers are such a big movement!.

I like action movies and horror movies.. What type of horror movies do you prefer?. I like scary movies that still have good/interesting plots. Not like jump-scare movies with poor storylines.. Have you seen the movie called Get Out?. No, what is it about?. It is about a young black man who is dating a white female and agrees to go have dinner with/meet her family. From the moment he arrives, nothing is as it seems.. Sounds interesting, I would be interesting in watching it.. The story pulls you deeper into it as the movie goes and makes you want to hold on, searching for answers, desperate to find out what the truth is and who you can really trust.. Wow, that sounds really cool. How long is it?. It's about 104 minutes long. The time passes quickly when watching it though as it drags you deeper into the plot.. Cool. I accept this recommendation.. Thank you! I hope you will enjoy watching it as much as I did!:). What is the film rated?. ", ". Hi there, I understand you are trying to find a movie trailer that interests you?. Yes, I am! Do you have any recommendations for what's out there?What does everyone seem to want to see?. There are all kinds of things out right now- what kind of movies do you like to see? Are there any genres that you don't like?. Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad. I don't like a lot of violence and language. I guess I'm in the mood for a feel good movie. Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting.. I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking! What is the last movie you watched if you don't mind my asking?. I last saw Little Women. It was good. I liked most of the actors. Maybe now I'm looking for something with a little more adventure. Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho.. Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation?. I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals. Like A Dog's Purpose. Very well done,but that was a while ago. Just thought there might be something similar out.. I understand! Have you read anything about the new Dolittle movie? It just recently came out in January so is relatively new. If not, what is it about that movie that disinterests you?. Oh yea! I haven't really read anything recently, but isn't that the one with Robert Downey Jr.?nWhat is it rated?. It is! It is rated PG, so a little more geared towards children however it combines action & adventure with comedy- a feel good movie you might say!. Hey! I think that is a great idea! As long as it's not rated G, it works for me. Not a fan of sitting in a theater with a bunch of little kids. I do like me some Robert Downey Jr! :) I will take your recommendation! Thank You!. Great! I sure hope you enjoy it! He is a great actor. I do feel that this one is the best adaptation of all of the Dolittle movies. Have you seen any of the older ones?. Yes, I saw the one with the guy from My Fair Lady, but that was a long time ago. Thanks again.. Yeah the other ones are pretty old and not my favorite to be honest. Did you ever seen the original one? It won a bunch of awards back in the day!. Not sure if it was the original or not, but it was the musical one. I actually liked it very mucn but I like musicals. They don't have many of those anymore. Mama Mia was good! Like most movies they should quit while they are ahead because the second one wasn't so good. Same thing happened with Grease.. Agreed! I was disappointed by the second Mama Mia as well, but know some who enjoyed it. I never did see the next Grease- what did you not like about it?. It did not have the original cast and the music just didn't have a spark.. ", ". Hello there. So, please tell me what kind of genre of movies you are into?. I love comedy and drama!. Do you like Adam Sandler movies?. I do, are there any new ones?. Have you heard of the new Adam Sandler movie called Uncut Gems?. No, I haven't. Uncut Gems stars Adam Sandler. It's about the stock market and the journey of a wall street start up beginner, who tries to make a name of himself. It's crime and suspense with wide notes of comical energy. It's based on a true store.. Oh, wow,that sounds like a good movie, so Adam plays a more serious type of role?. Yes, he does. I think it's pretty interesting considering he is known for his comedic side.. That would be an interesting movie to see, I wonder if he is good at being in a serious part. Have you seen it?. I have not seen it yet. But I am highly interested in seeing it, based on Sandler is one of my favortie comedians. Would you be interested in seeing it?. I would have to see a trailer before going to a theater, is it brand new or on a streaming service? I think he is very talented in comedy too.. The movie comes out December 25th of this year in theaters across the united states. I saw the trailer on Youtube. It looked really good!. Oh, Ok! So I can watch a trailer first and then wait for it to come out. I have enjoyed all of his movies and think I would seriously think about this one as well. Still a bit unsure do you know who else stars in the film?,.

Last one was this cheap found footage movie called Helll house LLC. Defintely exceeded my expectations, especially with the budget constraints.. Oh nice!

The plot to Get Out is superb and once your done definitely check out an interview with Peele, there are so many hidden double meanings and symbols. Its not jump-scare-y but definitely unnerving and well done. Definitely worth watching. I like the psychological stuff for sure. I've always liked Peele, thought he was the funniest of those two for sure. Glad to see him working in films.. Me too, that guy is so smart, I'm glad he's getting the recognition he deserves.

Watching a lot of movies during this coronavirus time?. Yes, on Disney and Netflix! Can't really watch them at the theaters right now.. Same here, I'm lucky I took my kids to the movies just in time last week.. Yes! That is good, got some good family time in before you're locked inside for who knows how long.. Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting.. Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha.. Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version.. Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/. 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie.. Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film?. Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard.. Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.. Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together!. I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible!. ", ". Hello there! I would like to help you with any movie trailer recommendations!. awesome. any ideas. I have a few. What type of movies have you watched in the last couple months?. jojo rabbit, knives out, shadow. I would first recommend Gemini Man with Will Smith. Awesome movie with plenty of action but also some plot twists that lead to an interesting plot.. I have not seen that movie yet. I've thought of watching it maybe. It highly recommend it. Smith rarely disappoints. Another one would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood if you like Tarantino movies or Ford vs Ferrari for a combination historical/suspense movie.. I will definitely watch it soon then. Tarantino's movies are the best. Excellent. Enjoy! Good chatting with you.. good bye. I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view. I will try to view them. buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot. ", ". Hi there!. Hello! How are you?. I am well, thanks for asking. Today I came to talk about your favorite movies as of recent times. What is your favorite movie that you've seen recently?. I just watched Ford v Ferrari last week and I really enjoyed it. Had good acting and I thought it was an interesting story.. That sounds like an interesting film! What genre would you categorize this movie as? Is i your favorite genre?. Its hard to categorize it, but I would say Action or History. It tells a real story in the movie and the story is entertaining and exciting. There is some action involved. I guess I like true stories about people who did things that were amazing and adventurous.. Oh, I see! So you like true stories, such as of historical figures of people who have accomplished notable things! I am trying to get the best picture of what makes you get on the edge of your seat when you watch.. Yeah they don't have to be war movies, but I do like those a lot as well.. And you mention war movies. Do you like the action aspect of war movies more, or the fact that it is real more? For example, do you also like action movies which are Marvel-based?. I do like Marvel movies as well. I haven't seen all of them but I watch Iron Man, and Captain America and liked those movies quite a bit. I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well.. I see. For you, I recommend Black Mass. This movie is a true biographical film which revolves around an alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob. This is also an action film.. I think I heard of that but I haven't seen it yet. Is that the movie that has Johnny Depp in it or an I thinking of the wrong movie?. That is correct! This movie has Johnny Depp and it is a true film telling of events which took place in the 1970's. You may like this movie if you end up watching it!. I think I really would. Its an interesting era to set the film in as well and I would like seeing the way they portray the 70's in the movie. I think I will watch that movie sounds like a good recommendation.. Do you appreciate these types of films which do take place in older times, aside from modern films?. I do like those a lot, even if I wasn't born in the time period. I just think seeing the old cars, the way people dressed, and less technology in the movies is interesting.. That is very nice. Then I think you will enjoy this movie. It can be characterized as being classic due to the elements you enjoy about older times.. Sounds great, thank you very much for your help..

I tend to lean towards action films; like Pacific Rim and Mad Max: Fury Road. Honestly if a movie involves a pretty woman controlling a big machine, I'll probably love it. Do you have any recommendations?. Haha. I tend to go that way too. I am also a huge Star wars fan. You'll definitely enjoy the new James Bond, action and story.. Okay, I accept your recommendation. Thank you!. Enjoy, and I'm sure you'll check out the new Black Widow movie.. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Marvel. I think I'm a bit burned out. I did like the most recent Thor movie though.

So, I am thinking about something that maybe is thought-provoking but also has fantasy elements.. What's one movie you liked that was similar to this?. Ok, so, I really like MCU and Pixar movies.. So you like more superhero and/or a decidedly good vs. evil kind of though provoking fantasy?. Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it.. Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception. It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie.. Oh yeah that movie is great.. Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige?. Not yet, but I'm intersted.. I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. It's got so many good actors in it, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and several more big name actors.. Alright I accept your recommendation.. I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie. Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan?. Huh, really? Well, not that one either, what is it about?. It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less. The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think.

Is that the movie you are interested in?. Yes, that is the movie I am interested in. I like action and flying, so I think it could be fun. Should we watch the trailer for Top Gun Maverick? The movie itself doesn't come out until summer.. Yes sounds like a good idea. Especially when you are a big fan of Tom Cruise. You seem to be a fan as well, which of the Mission Impossible movies is your favorite?. I like 4-6. I liked the first three too but they don't compare to the last three ones. What about you?. Same, the newer ones are way more rewatchable and have great stunts too. 1-3 are a bit dated. Well let's watch the Top Gun Maverick trailer and try to figure out how they did these stunts! What do you say?. Sounds great! Let me know if you liked the trailer. It looks so exciting. I think Tom Cruise is a licensed pilot and you can really tell he knows what he's doing up there.. Yeah he does most of movie stunts himself doesn't he? He is very committed to acting. Yeah, did you see in MI: Fallout he broke his ankle and kept going? That is dedication!.

Can't really watch them at the theaters right now.. Same here, I'm lucky I took my kids to the movies just in time last week.. Yes! That is good, got some good family time in before you're locked inside for who knows how long.. Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting.. Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha.. Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version.. Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/. 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie.. Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film?. Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard.. Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.. Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together!. I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible!. Exactly they carry on their same Avengers likeability to Upward, plus the mom is Julia Louis Dreyfus and she's hillarious too. Oh! That's good! I like her as an actress! I love them in the Avengers!.

I'm definitely okay with it but I cringe away from excessive gore.. You might like Knives Out. Its currently playing and has Daniel Craig in the lead. What type of horror movie is it? Is it more of a thriller or a psychological horror film?. I would say psycological thriller. that's my favorite genre. You said it's in theaters now?. yes it is. How often does the movie rely on jump scares to make it a scary movie? Those can get boring and predictable. it doesnt look like it. more of head games. Oh that's great. What is the main character like?. He is a little mysterious, likes hes hiding somehing. He's untrustworthy?. ", ". hi, how are you doing tonight?. I'm doing well, how are you?. I am doing good.

I like to watch movies at home via streaming.. What streaming service(s) do you gravitate towards?. I usually use Netflix for watching movies.. What was the last Netflix film that really grabbed you?. I really enjoyed watching Saving Mr. Banks. Do you like historical dramas?. I like historical dramas if they are set past the year 1900.. I feel like I'm the same way. Why would you say that it?. I feel that movies that are more recent are able to be portrayed more accurately. I don't like watching actors fake accents of the way people used to talk before we had audio recording available.. Older settings really allow for some creative liberties but the accuracy suffers. I agree.. I do enjoy movies that are surrounding World War II. I also like to watch documentaries.. Did you see Dunkirk?. I did not see that movie.. It's a strong cinematic achievement but harder to connect with on a human level because of the point of view it adopts.. I understand that, I do tend to have a hard time enjoying films that have won many awards such as The Black Swan, Moneyball, and Hugo.. I am going to strongly recommend Hacksaw Ridge.

Awesome! Action movies are my favorite genre as well. What was the last action movie you saw in theaters?. Super hero something...I don't quite recall. We usually watch at home since we have a son on the spectrum and a huge TV to accommodate our movie enjoyment.. Yeah I know what you mean. Getting out to the movies is tough with kids. Have you seen the new Bad Boys movie with Will Smith?. No. I enjoyed the first one though. It should be entertaining. I like most of Will Smith's work..

Are there any other super hero movies out now? We may catch Bad Boys for Life at home sometime, but the Marvel movies tend to have more depth, some unexpected plot twists or character shifts. Bad Boys is pretty straightforward, and while it's a fun trip, it's one we probably won't pay to see in theatres.. There aren't many superhero movies out right now, but you might enjoy Birds of Prey. It's a comic book based movie starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. These aren't Marvel movies but most people that enjoy the Marvel series enjoy these as well.

Well, I wasn't able to find the movie trailer for Birds of Prey but I've selected the Suicide Squad trailer for you to watch. It has the main character of Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn, in it as well.

Am I heading in the right direction?. i did see black panther, never saw death wish though i thought that was a brosnen movie from the 70's lol.. Haha, well it is, but there is a new one with Bruce Willis who is a surgeon in a hospital, his wife gets brutally attacked along with his daughter from a home invasion he becomes a vigilante, it's pretty good.. i may have seen something about that now that you mention that story hook.. or there is Mission Impossible Fallout, or Deadpool 2.... ive seen the first MI didnt like it that much, was good but not great. deadpool now thats a good one loved both. ive been wanting to watch once upon a deadpool also.. ok, great!

We still have to talk back and forth for several more turns. So let me ask you. Have you seen the old version of It?. Oh, I did not realize. I actually did see the 1990 version (on TV). Which one do you think is better - new or old?. Well I think the new version is creepier in my opinion. But not sure the chapter II is that good.. Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot. I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it!. I definitely will check it out - are you a Stephen King fan?. Yes of course! I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie?. The Shining was solid. Obviously, the Jack Nicholson version was a classic. A favorite definitely. I also liked a little known TV film and book called Rose Red...underrated.. Great! I see you and I have a lot in common! I feel exactly the same about the Shining. Though I don't know much about Rose Red, it sounds great too..

An Anderson gangster film would be...an awesome combination in my opinion. Some nice pastels lining the dark alleyways. Anyhow, I think I have a suggestion! Particularly if you like comedy as well and don't mind the gangster side of things being more of a side plot element.. Ha, at the very least it would be interesting. Lay it on me.

Stephen King provides some thrilling content for movies! Are you a fan of his?. Yea I have read alot of his work and seen most of his films, the new pet sematary was pretty decent and I am looking forward to the TommyKnockers adaptation. Agreed, it should be a good combination of science fiction and horror! What did you enjoy most about pet seminary?. It managed to stay true to the source material, whilst changing a few key elements to keep it fresh and update it for a new audience. Do you follow Stephen King on social media? He has a list of movies he personally recommends.. I didnt know that he did that, what kinds of movies does he reccomend. He recommends new indie horror movies to his fans, I'd recommend checking out The Autopsy of Jane Doe.. I loved the autopsy of jane doe it was one of my favorite new horror films. It's the #1 recommendation. I'd also recommend Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch 2. I havent seen Blair Witch 2 but I was not a big fan of the first one. Yeah, if you didn't enjoy the first one I'd stay away from it too. Have you seen STIR OF ECHOES?. I dont think I have, Kevin Bacon right?. ", ". hello there.

Cheeky Comedy movies tend to be my favorite right now. Family movies such as Disney are always lovable. Funny you ask, I am actually looking for a recommendation.. Glad to hear! You should check out Shazam! It's very funny and fun and if you're a Disney fan definitely watch Toy Story 4.. Shazam was an awesome movie I must say. I would watch it again however i must accept your second recommendation of Toy Story 4. Those were amazing movies and I specifically like the first one the most. Although that is my stance, it may soon change after watching the 4th one. In my best Woody voice: Thanks partner. Also check out the comedy classic Groundhog Day, Bill Murray is great in it. Also, if the kids are pokemon fans give Detective Pikachu a chance.. Bill Murray is a very famous actor and has been in quite a few movies now. He is easily one of the greatest to do it. I have heard of Groundhog Day and maybe seen it before but wouldn't hurt to check it out. I have heard great things about that new movie detective Pikachu, I believe it has Ryan Reynolds as the main character of course other than Pikachu. Fun movie think that came out this year?. Definitely check out Jojo Rabbit, it was written and directed by the director of Thor Ragnarok, Taika Waititi. You can also check out Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.. Got it.

I agree, I really loved the ending to Pacific Rim. The characters were great. Are you familiar with the direct Guillermo Del Toro?. Yes I am, he does some good movies. I'm looking for something new though in that style of movie.. Are you a fan of creatures and aliens then?. Both appeal to me a great deal!. Do you enjoy the aliens that help humans or try to kill the human species, or even both? lol. Both are great and I really enjoy. Also I especially enjoy if they have both in the movie as well.:). Me too! You have the good aliens and then the bad aliens that throw you through a ringer haha. What's your opinion on Robot movies?. I do enjoy Robot movies, if the special effects are up to par for them.. Did you watch Ex Machina?. Yes I really enjoyed the movie.. Yeah the 3D robots were done very well and the story line kept me super involved. I'm curious if you have also watched The Arrival? It's an alien one. It really didn't get me, I preferred something like skyline or Battle for los angles. ", ". Hi! How are you doing tonight?. I'm good, how are you?. I'm doing great tonight. Are you looking for a movie to watch?. Yes! I usually watch action, horror, and comedies.. Oh, I love horror and comedies myself! Have you seen It 2?. Yes, it was okay, the book was better.. Stephen King does write some crazy good books. Hmm, have you seen A Quiet Place?. Yes, I've seen a lot of movies. One of my favorite Horror movies is The Poughkeepsie tapes. I've never heard of that one. Maybe you should be recommending instead of me!. Haha, but it's always great when someone knows a good movie that you've never heard of.. That's so true! What did you like best about Poughkeepsie Tapes?. It's something that could really happen and it's crazy and scary. I don't want to give away any of the movie to say why it's great. I watched it without knowing anything about it and was surprised that it wasn't more well known.. Definitely don't spoil it for me! Since it's very good, maybe you'd like to watch it again instead of a new one?. No, I usually watch it once a year or every two years. Have you seen the new Hansel and Gretel movie? I think it's called Gretel, I wonder if that's good.. ", ". Hello!. Hi there!. Do you know what kind of movies do you like?. I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers. I also love horror! I am not a fan of action films or romance much.. What was the last horror movie you watched?. I saw Midsommar in theaters. I didn't think it was scary, more just upsetting, I really liked Hereditary which is from the same director. I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake!. I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic! I think the casting was perfect. oh my gosh YES! I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect. Did you see Get Out or Us? What did you think? I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes. I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me..

I tend to lean more towards horror movies but I have a guilty pleasure for romantic comedy, too.. I love to watch horror movies myself! What is the last move that you have seen?. It's been awhile since I've watched a good horror movie. I think the last one that I watched was probably IT and I tend to watch the Scream movies over and over again. I like good horror movies that make you think, have good characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.. Those are the best kinds of movies when you are on the edge of your seat. I love that penny wise smile, nothing will ever compare to it. Have you ever seen any of the Insidious series?. I don't think that I have! Are they any good? What are they about?. They are one of my favorite scary movies. They all follow a different person every movie but it is about someone being taken into a different dimension of the world they live in.. That sounds like it perfectly describes a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just my kind of movie! I'd love to give them a try and start watching as soon as I can. Thanks for the recommendation!. They are a little bit of an older movie but I really enjoy them and will watch them over and over.. They sound like a perfect recommendation for me!. The movie has had 8 wins and 15 nominations for awards.. How do you feel about the acting in the movie? Is it cheesy or do they do a nice job?. They did a very nice job acting and selecting the actors and actresses for the movie.. Okay, awesome. I think you had me at being taking into different dimensions I love this suggestion. Thank you!.

How are you doing today? I am here to try to find a movie trailer that you would like to view. Are you ready?. Hello! I am well, thanks! I am ready!. First off, what is your favorite kind of movie to watch - drama, action, comedy, etc?. I definitely don't care a lot for drama. I would say horror/thriller, action, and comedy are probably my favorite genres.. Those are my favorites too! Have you seen the latest Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise?. I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list.. I would have to agree with you on this. I think half of the movie was chase scenes of one sort or another.. It can be fun, but bot when it takes up most of the movie.. Have you seen any of the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise? While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot.. I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting.. You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!. Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?. The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!. Thanks for that information. I am definitely interested in this and accept your recommendation.. Great! Glad I could help! Hope you enjoy the trailer and enjoy the movie!. Thanks again. Do you happen to know how many movies are out about this character?. There are two in this series so far, with a new one out soon. The first was Jack Reacher in 2012 and then Jack Reacher: Never Go Back in 2016.. Awesome. So If I like it, there are additional ones to watch!. ", ". ", ".

I'm also always down for a good horror film.. Have you seen the film Us?

Jennifer Aniston stars in that one next to Jason Bateman. Do you like them? would you be interested in me telling you a little about The Switch or is there a certain Rom-Com movie you already had an idea of.. Oh okay, I know the movie switch.

I am doing pretty good just surviving this storm we have going on with all this corona virus stuff lol. It actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies I have fallen behind on. I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch?. Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies.. I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!. Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!. Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?. Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.. Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J. Thanks again! Have a good one :). Hey I think I can actually send this trailer to you if you would like?. Actually that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. Thanks!. Of course. I am working on getting that over to you now or I can send you a link to the right one.. Okay thanks, I appreciate it as i'm not too savvy on the computer. Do you have a link by chance?. You got it! Also, What was the last thing you saw Will Smith in aside from this movie you are going to watch tonight?. Perfect, thanks! I would have to say the latest release of Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence. I can't remember if the name is Bad Boys 3 or a spinoff name like Bad Boys Reloaded - Also I wanted to see him in Gemini Man but never did. Have you heard how that movie is or seen it?.

Hello, how are you today?. I am very well. Actually I'm bored and looking for a movie to watch.. I saw a fantastic movie this weekend with my granddaughter. It was Frozen 2. Have you seen a movie recently?. I have seen a lot of movies. I don't mind animation but it's far from my favorite genre.. I enjoy all movies. What is your favorite genre?. Horror is my favorite genre but I'm not big on gore. I like dramas like gangster and war movies. I also like comedies but humor is so subjective.. I also watched Road House this past week. It is an older movie. The longer I watched it, the more I realized they would never produce a movie like that nowadays. Do you have a favorite movie? Mine, I would have to say is Dances with Wolves.. It's been a long time since I've seen Road House. I like so many that I can't pick a favorite. I love The Thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Fright Night, Goodfellas, Platoon. Recently I really enjoyed Joker and Doctor Sleep.. Two of my favorite actors are in Road House. Sam Elliott and Patrick Swayze! You know, you said you like horror. Have you watched the Ring? That movie gave me the creeps. If you haven't seen it, the movie trailer will give you a good idea of what it is about.. I have but only the original Japanese one and the American remake. None of the sequels. I like Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski a lot.. How about Paranormal Activity? Would you like to see the trailer for that movie? It was creepy!. I have seen that one. It was very creepy. I know some people don't like hand held or shaky cam movies but it never bothered me.. It doesn't really bother me either. Depends on the film though! I have a huge collection of thrillers. That is my favorite genre, unless I am down in the dumps, then I watch some comedy! The Changeling was also a good movie. Did you see that one? It was back in the 70's I believe.. I did. I do like ghost movies. The Shining is fantastic. Do you have any recommendations in that sub-genre?. I love the psychological horror films. Silence of the Lambs? I am sure you have seen that.. Yes. I do like those kind of horror thrillers as well though. Do you have a more recent ghost or psychological horror recommendations?. Don't Let Go!! It didn't get the best reviews but I enjoyed it. I have not seen that one. I would love to check it out. I have never even heard of it.. ", ". Hey. Hey. I'm looking for a movie that is slow and contemplative.. Okay. How are you today?. I am very good. Just looking for a movie that fits these parameters. Any recommendations?. Trying to ask questions but you are way ahead of yourself. Since you want to get right into it and keep asking questions about movies instead of socialize. What movies have you watched recently?. Sorry boss. Just excited to hear what you have to recommend -- that's why we're here after all. The most recent film I watched was 1917. I quite liked it.. Have you seen any other Steven King movies?. I love Shawshank Redemption.. That's always a classic. Have you watched The Shining?. I have not. I'm familiar with the here's Johnny meme though.. Well, I'd definitely recommend it as the new Doctor Sleep film that's just come out is a sequel and expecting to be amazing.. Oh, I didn't know that! I'll have to check it out.. Definitely suggest it. Do you have any favorite series or producer otherwise?. Iain Smith is a favorite producer of mine.. Ah, a good choice! Did you see Mad Max Fury Road?. Oh yeah. What a blast.. Awesome. For something with more thought and a different story, have you ever seen Touch?. I haven't even heard of it. What's it about?. It's about a deaf woman who experiences a home invasion.

Do you remember the old Rambo moivees?. Yes I have seen some of the older Rambo movies. That looks like such a great movie to watch.. I know right, I think you will like it if you like action.. I do like it and I definitely going to see the full movie.. Cool, I am glad I could recommend something you will watch and probably love.. The part that I like the most is him having to go against all the bad guys to save the young woman.. That is always a classic. For being so old, he is still taking care of himself.. Yes I noticed that especially when they were showing flashes of his young self he really doesn't look that different.. It is a tie between him and Arnold as my favorite action hero of all time.. Yea I agree, I love Arnold and I hope he doesn't ever stop making the terminator series.. I hope Van Damme makes a comeback. He was awesome as well..

He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film.. I loved the X-Men movies. Do you have any recommendation on superhero movies as well?. Hands down would be Deadpool and Deadpool 2 especially if you love the X-Men!. I saw the first one, is Deadpool 2 about a similar plot?. Only a little. It pushes more as a continuation from the first one. Deadpool actually gets a team together and learns the meaning of family.. What do you think about the new Joker?. To be honest, I haven't seen it yet but it's on my top list! I know it doesn't follow the DC line but it puts a human face to Joker which is something that has never been done. I love that kind of in depth cinema. I can't wait to see it.. I just recently saw it and definitely think it's bound to get an Oscar nomination! What did you think off Avengers Endgame?.

Have you seen a movie recently?. I have seen a lot of movies. I don't mind animation but it's far from my favorite genre.. I enjoy all movies. What is your favorite genre?. Horror is my favorite genre but I'm not big on gore. I like dramas like gangster and war movies. I also like comedies but humor is so subjective.. I also watched Road House this past week. It is an older movie. The longer I watched it, the more I realized they would never produce a movie like that nowadays. Do you have a favorite movie? Mine, I would have to say is Dances with Wolves.. It's been a long time since I've seen Road House. I like so many that I can't pick a favorite. I love The Thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Fright Night, Goodfellas, Platoon. Recently I really enjoyed Joker and Doctor Sleep.. Two of my favorite actors are in Road House. Sam Elliott and Patrick Swayze! You know, you said you like horror. Have you watched the Ring? That movie gave me the creeps. If you haven't seen it, the movie trailer will give you a good idea of what it is about.. I have but only the original Japanese one and the American remake. None of the sequels. I like Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski a lot.. How about Paranormal Activity? Would you like to see the trailer for that movie? It was creepy!. I have seen that one. It was very creepy. I know some people don't like hand held or shaky cam movies but it never bothered me.. It doesn't really bother me either. Depends on the film though! I have a huge collection of thrillers. That is my favorite genre, unless I am down in the dumps, then I watch some comedy! The Changeling was also a good movie. Did you see that one? It was back in the 70's I believe.. I did. I do like ghost movies. The Shining is fantastic. Do you have any recommendations in that sub-genre?. I love the psychological horror films.

What is the latest movie you have watched?. I watched Frozen 2 last week!. Wonderful! Now, do you want something similar or to switch it up?. I want to switch it up, but would like a comedy. Understood! I think there are some great options available for you. Are you excited?. Very excited. I think you should consider Knives Out, starring Jamie Lee Curtis.

I think you are going to enjoy it. While I set that up, can you tell me do you watch a lot of movies?. Yes I go to the movie theater once or twice per week.

It's a man that has around 25 different personalities that are trying to make the world pure. Watching the actor shift between characters really plays with your mind.. Wow, that sounds interesting. Who's the main actor? Must have been hard to play 25 different people. He's James McAvoy, he's also the younger Professor X from the X-Men movies. He dd an amazing job jumping between characters. He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film.. I loved the X-Men movies. Do you have any recommendation on superhero movies as well?. Hands down would be Deadpool and Deadpool 2 especially if you love the X-Men!. I saw the first one, is Deadpool 2 about a similar plot?. Only a little.

Can you recommend a good movie to watch?. I would love to! Do you have any specific genres you prefer?. I like Harry Potter type stuff. Also action/drama. I am obsessed with Harry Potter! So hard to compare to other movies. Do you have a movie you've watched recently that you liked?. Not really. Honestly movies can easily pu me to sleep so I like something engaging to hold my interest. A good example is The Matrix.. I can tell you like a lot of suspense and action. Have you watched or thought about watching the Mission Impossible movies? Tom Cruise gives a great story!. I have not watched or thought about those. That's a good suggestion I think. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan but maybe I'd enjoy the films.. Perhaps based off your enjoyment of Harry Potter you like a more fantasy style of action. I really love to watch Lord of the Rings with my family. It is a very wild and action filled plot set in another world with magic. Do you think those movies would interest you?. Absolutely! I've seen them and although lengthy, I was captivated and enjoyed them a lot. I also am interested in anything about King Arthur or Merlin. Amazing! I feel like we have similar tastes so I would like to recommend Mortal Engines for you to view.. Really? Mortal Engines. I have never heard of it but on your advise, I would check it out.. In is based off a book like the movies you have previously mentioned. You follow a girl in a post-apocalyptic world trying to fight for a better world. Do you think you would watch this movie trailer?. Yes! It interests me.. Perfect! You have a great taste in movies and I think that you may really enjoy this movie. Is there any concerns you may have regarding my choice for you?. Thank you for the sweet compliment. No concerns regarding your recommendation. I am going to try to find the movie.. Awesome, I am so glad that I could help your search in your movie preferences.. I wrote the title down so I will remember. ....Mortal Engines. Haha I love that. Have a great day and Enjoy!. Thanks so much. You have a great day also....by the way ....where are you right now?? I'm just curious. I am in Michigan.. ", ". ", ". Hello!. hi.

What is the last movie that you saw?. The last movie I saw was Avengers: End Game.. Do you normally prefer movies based on comics?. Yes, I do. I really enjoy actions movies, in general.. What do you like about them?. I like the fast pace of the film. I like watching someone do something on screen that I can't.. Same here! Joker is a really great origin story, but if you like an action-packed comedy, I'd really recommend Zombieland 2.. I've heard really good things about Joker. It may be a bit too dark for me. What is the plot about?. It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character. It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character.. Hm, sounds very interesting. I do like comic book movies as well. What is the plot of Zombieland 2?. Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse. The second movie shows them years later as they have grown into more of a family unit, and some drama threatens their relationship.. The plot sounds pretty scary and funny. Who stars in Zombieland 2?. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.. Wow, I really like Woody Harrelson's acting. That sounds like a good movie. Who was the director?. It's directed by Ruben Fleischer. Zombieland is his best known movie!. Did you see the 1st film? Do you think I would have to see the 1st film to understand the 2nd?. I did see the first film, but everything is explained pretty well in the second one so you wouldn't need to see the first film to understand.. That sounds good. I'll accept your recommendation of Zombieland 2.. ", ". Good afternoon, how are you?. hEY! i'M GOOD, YOURSELF?. I'm doing well. How's the family?. Great, sorry about those caps. I'mm trying to find a movie everyone can watch.. It's fine. Yea? Safe to assume family friendly? Or is everyone an adult?. Not too picky as long as its not filthy. Hmm, what do you think about romantic comedies then?. That works.. I think, you guys could like Crazy Rich Asians. It's more on the family friendly side, an a few adult jokes.. What that about?. Its based on a global bestseller, follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu to Singapore to meet her boyfriend's family.. Sounds interesting. That'd be good to watch.. ", ". Hello!. Hi, how are you?.

You might really like those if you like explosive action movies with cars and tough guys.. yes I have seen the previous all. How about the new James Bond movies?

Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Do you have a movie recommendation?. Sure, what kind of movies do you enjoy?. I enjoy romantic comedies, action, and children's movies.. Pixar has a great selection of children's movies that also appeal to adults, are you familiar with Pixar?. Yes, that is from Disney right?. Disney owns them, but they do their own work. I highly recommend the movie Up. It's a heart warming journey with a little boy and his talking dog. They float their house with balloons and go on an adventure.. Is that the one with the older man as well?. Yes, very colorful and little sad at first but a fun journey. Would you prefer something less modern?. No I think that would be great. I haven't watched it because it looked sad, but I think I'll give it a try.. Hmm it seems that I can't recommend up at the moment, but here is a similar title called The BFG. I have seen that movie before. Is there anything else you can recommend?. Sure, going back to my animated recommendations Ratatouille is fantastic. About a mouse that wants to become a chef and moves to paris. That sounds interesting. Is it funny?. ", ". Hey, I here to help you look for a movie trailer?. Yes, what would you recommend? I love all genres, thriller, drama, suspense, family, drama. love meryl streep and marlee matlin. That's great!! Do you know what kind you would want to see right now?. drama, suspense, something to keep me intrigued and holds my attention the entire movie. Well awesome! Well what is the last movie you seen?. honestly...last night the Grinch...but over the weekend I watch the newest Child's Play movie (chucky). I enjoy watching Child's play too. whats your favorite scene?. I've never been a fan of child's play, but my sister wanted me to watch this one...the best one out of them all...there were a few funny parts where chucky (now named buddi) would repeat what was said, explicit stuff, but funny coming from a doll and the way he would say it. It was a gruesome but tolerable movie. Aww ok great. I can relate as well on that. He has such a explicit vocabulary but funny at times. exactly...my favorite horror movies is like the conjuring franchise...anything Ed and Lorraine Warrren..i have seen them all....any recomendations. How about Annabelle Comes Home. loved it...she absolutely freaks me out...dolls and clowns scare me on a whole new level. Great I remember you saying you like drama and suspense movies?

Would you prefer to watch The Conjuring 2 instead?. if I had to choose out of the two, for sure Conjuring 2.. ", ". Hi. I'm here to make some good movie recomendations.. hi, thankyou for being here.

It does have a happy ending and I think your kids will love it.. Thank you for the recommendation. I Accept This.. Thanks. I do have other movies for you and your kids as well.

I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary.. Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?. My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard.. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.. The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated?. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.. ", ". Hi! Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in?. I normally love comedies.. Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?. I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though.. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?. That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres?. I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?. I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy.. Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!. I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it.. Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!. That does sound pretty perfect!. I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy.. I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha!. Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself.. I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;). Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it.. Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie?. The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it. Its moving and touching in all the right ways!. Well that sounds like a dream. Can you tell me a little about the plot? I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself.. Of course! I suppose using today's standards, it would be considered a dramedy (drama comedy) and is traces the life of Midler's character who teamed up with Caan's character, Eddie Sparks, who was a famous entertainer. He thinks he needs something to help bolster his act so he enlists the help of Dixie Leonard, Midler's character. They primarily get together to train US Troops during the war.. Wait a minute. They're entertainers but they train the military?. Oh gosh. I'm sorry, not train, entertain....my goodness. Please forgive my mind!. HAHA! It's totally okay. I was like What qualifies showman to train the military?! Haha! So Bette Midler has some singing in it?. Yes! I know its not a popular stance, but I adore her voice. Its so soulful!. I love it too! That's definitely a selling point for me! This movie sounds absolutely perfect. I can't believe I've never heard of it. I will definitely have to check it out!. Well hopefully the trailer sells you completely. Though I'm sure you'll love it!. Should I watch the trailer first?. I always encourage people to watch trailers because there can always be that one thing that they can see in the trailer that can make them excited to see it or hesitant. Either way, I'd rather walk into something with somewhat of an idea of what I'm walking into.. You're right! Should I watch now or watch it before we end this chat, just in case...?. ", ". Hi! I'm here to help you find a trailer!. Sounds great, what do you recommend?. Hmm depends. What kinda genre are you looking for?. I prefer a suspense movie. Oh those are good ones! What was the last one you watched?. I just watched Shutter Island, big fan. That was a good movie! You must like the edge of your-seat-kind of suspense. I'd totally recommend the movie Split!. What is that about?. It's a man that has around 25 different personalities that are trying to make the world pure. Watching the actor shift between characters really plays with your mind.. Wow, that sounds interesting. Who's the main actor? Must have been hard to play 25 different people. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Old School was so funny!

Can I asked what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? Maybe your favorite genre?. Sure! I have been looking for a nice Christmas movie. I like really cheesy stuff around this time of year.. Wow, me too! One of my favorite movies is A Christmas Story I grew up watching it every year with my family. Do you think that is something you could be interested in?. Definitely, but I've seen it a lot. Do you think you may know of something a bit newer?. How about A Christmas Prince? It is about a journalist who goes abroad to get some information on a prince who is in line to become king. That sounds fantastic. Who is in it?. The two main cast members are Rose Mclver and Ben Lamb.. Have they been in anything I would have heard of?. Rose Mclver has been in iZombie and The lovely bones whereas Ben Lamb as been in Divergent. Fantastic. Is it going to be in theaters or is the movie on a streaming service?. ", ". Hey, my friend. What is going on?. Hello! Just preparing everything to go back to work tomorrow. How about you?. I'm good. Just came back from the theatre. I hear you need some help in selecting a movie to see.. I would indeed. I was hoping that you may have some ideas on a good movie to see.. What type of film do you usually like?. I have several genre's that I like. I enjoy comedies that aren't silly dumb. I also like everyday neighbor type movies.. Well, along the lines of the last one, there is A beautiful day in the neighborhood. Its about Mr. Rogers.. Hmmm. Who is in that one?. He had a famous childrens show for a while. But he was apparantly a really interesting person in real life. It got great reviews and stars Tom Hanks.. Oh, I usually like Tom Hanks. I remember a little bit about Mr. Rogers. Is it a comedy or more of a biography?. It is a biography. But its funny.. It sounds like something that I would enjoy. I will accept your recommendation.. Cool. But before you go...I just rewatched There's something about Mary. Its a classic comedy...if you want to stay at home.. Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?. Yes. Matt Damon and Bed Stiller too. A cameo by Brett Favre is also in there.. I don't remember Brett Favre. I think the movie was a bit crude, if I remember. That's not really my thing.. Well then by all means stick with a beautiful day in the neighborhood. You love it. Nothing crude about it.. Do you have any other ideas for being at home? I do like to have options.. ", ".

Hello, I'm here to help recommend you a movie! How are you?. I'm great! How are you? I'm a huge fan of horror films - particularly those that deal more with dread than gore.. Oh man, I love horror movies! What have you seen recently that you liked?. The last horror film I saw and liked was A Quiet Place. Such a unique film that relied on silence!. I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different?. A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!. I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.. Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dread in horror. Can you explain to me what The Transfiguration is about?. ", ". Hello how are you my name is Alex. Hey Alex, any movie recommendations?. I like to watch older movies. any monty python movies or lethal weapon movies are great. Love Lethal Weapon flicks! Only saw Monty Python and Holy Grail but loved it!. They are classics. I saw naked gun for the first time in a while the other night. Also saw Scarface for the first time last week. What movies have you seen recently?. Both excellent flicks but vastly different haha! I love older flicks as well. Saw three Oclock High and Doctor Sleep! Both solid flicks!. I have never seen those ones, I got to check them out. What do you like about those movies?. One is classic 80s comedy, the other was a solid sequel to the Shining! Very well made and I am a sucker for Horror! Well. Gotchu, I gotta check those out but I should watch The Shining first. I surprisingly have never seen it although I always hear about it. I love horror as well. Have you seen Amityville horror?. Not in a long time!!! I would like to watch that! Not sure how to do it but I accept that recommendation haha!!. ", ". hello, My name is Matt and i am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi Matt, nice to meet you!. nice to meet you aswell. What kinda movies are you in to. I particularly like Animated Flicks like Frozzen or Mohana.. I enjoy those types of movies sometimes. But I'm really into SciFi and Horror movies.. ScyFi, cool. Have you seen the new Terminator Movie? they brohgt back Linda Hammiltton to repreice her role as Sarah Connor. Yes I did see it and loved it. I really like that they brought back Arnold and Linda for that movie. Underworld is my current favorite. Love movies about vampires and werewolves too.. How about Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman about the notorious monster hunter trying to stop Dracula,. Oh that sounds interesting. When was it released?. It came out on 2004. i like it a lot. the effects still hold up to this day and the story is actually really good, it has good twists and adventure. sounds like something I would like, thank you for the suggestion. Any other movies like that, that I might like?. I am Legend with Will smith, i like the version of vampires in this movie, vampires created by science in look for a cure for cancer. oh wow that sounds like a good storyline.

The live action have been great beside mavels. Do you have any specific examples?. Loin King and one out side of Disney was The Courier. Was the Lion King as good as the original animated one?. ", ". Hello! Have you seen any awesome movies lately?. Yes I have. I've seen 1917 and Joker.. Nice, Joker is a wonderful movie, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. I have not seen 1917, what is it about?. It is about World War I and two British soldiers going behind enemy lines to save over a thousand of their fellow soldiers.It was very suspenseful.. Sounds interesting, I definitely have to check it out. If you enjoy movies about war I highly recommend Dunkirk.. I have hard of Dunkirk but haven't seen that one. I like such movies that are based on history and full of suspense and have surprise endings. I will have to check that one out.. You'll love Dunkirk, it is about the Allied evacuation of France during World War 2. It's a drama, but there is plenty of action. Have you seen Saving Private Ryan?. Yes I have seen Saving Private Ryan some years ago. It was one of my favorites, well acted with a great plot and plenty of action.. Definitely agree, also the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are easily some of the best in cinema history. Steven Spielberg is a genius. Do you enjoy super hero movies?. No, Super Hero Movies not as much, I do like the Batman franchise though. I will definitely take your recommendation for Dunkirk.. I'm glad to hear it. If you don't mind me asking, what are your dislikes about super hero franchises?. I find Super Hero movies too predictable and repetitious of previous super hero movies.. Ah alright, and out of the Batman franchise, what are your likes?. Dark Knight, Justice League, Joker. Cool, between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix whom do you think is the better joker?. I prefer Joaquin Phoenix but Heath Ledger was quite good also. I just thinkg Joaquiin plays a darker deranged character. Agreed, Joaquin plays a more down to earth Joker. While I feel Ledger's joker is more stylized, I think he's more like the comic book version overall. Did you like Suicide Squad?. I can't say I did. I didn't like the actors and overall theme of the movie.. It certainly was lukewarm, thought Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was wonderful. Did you watch Harley Quinn:Birds of Prey?. No, Harley Quinn Birds of Prey I have NOT seen..

Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes. Truly one of Keanu Reeves' best movies since the Matrix trilogy in my opinion.. I dont think i have seen those before, what genre are they?. I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times.. okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre?. I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind.. That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks!. No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems.. Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies. Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character.. OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing!. Thank you for the compliment, but I'm no expert I just happened to notice it was him and when you mentioned the Dark Knight films I was like, Oh yeah I remember he directed that movie.. Haha, wierd. What are some other ones similar to memento that you like?. That's a tough one because it is a unique film, but going off of the genre you mentioned earlier, psychological drama, I think Identity is another good one where the main guy has schizophrenia and his personalities end up killing each other within his own head. It's quite a brain twister.. oh wow, that makes me think of that movie, A Beautiful Mind. Yes that one is also excellent, a classic Russell Crowe movie.. yeah, that one was also pretty sad. ", ". Hey there! I'm Rachel, who are you?. Hi Rachel, I am Kevin.. What kind of movies are your favorite kevin?. I like the Avengers movies and superhero movies in general. I like science fiction and drama.. Thats cool! What was the last movie you watched?. Thanks. The last movie I watched was Brittany runs a Marathon on Amazon Prime Video.. What did you like and dislike about that movie?. I liked that the movie featured people of color, not just that, how it also featured an overweight woman. I liked that there was a triumph at the end for the movie's protagonist.. Oh yeah, I enjoy movies like that too.. Nice, yeah. The movie kind of addressed some issues that I have been thinking about on my down time as well. What kind of movies do you like?. Pretty much the same as you. Have you ever seen Goldengirl?. No, I have not.. It came out in 1979, a doctor tries to make a superwoman out of his daughter. Does that sound like something you would enjoy?. It sounds scary. I might not like it. Not many old films are worth watching, and I have not heard of this before today.. How about starship troopers 2: Hero of the federation? It came out in 2004. It is an action packed Sci-Fi film. That might be good. Does it have good reviews? Is there a Starship Troopers 1?. ", ". Hi, I hear you're looking for a film to watch!. hi yes i am. Awesome! What's your favorite movie?. inglorious bastards. Oh, that's a fantastic movie! Tarantino is a genius. Have you seen his latest film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?. yes i did. Did you like it? Are you a fan of Oscar-nominated films?. yes i am. I think they're pretty great too, most of the time. I have a friend who really likes Inglourious Basterds and also really likes Black Book. Have you heard of it?. i do not. Black Book is a 2006 Dutch war film with a very similar tone to Tarantino's films. It's witty, insightful, violent, and sexy. Are you interested in watching the trailer?. yes i am. Huh, it looks like our database doesn't have international films listed. Another film I recommend is True Romance, starring Brad Pitt. Again, very similar vibe. I can get that trailer for you if you like.. i accept.

Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?.

Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes. Truly one of Keanu Reeves' best movies since the Matrix trilogy in my opinion.. I dont think i have seen those before, what genre are they?. I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times.. okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre?. I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind.. That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks!. No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems.. Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies. Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character.. OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing!. ", ". Hello. hello. What kind of movies do you enjoy?. action movies and comedy are my top 2 favorite genres. Awesome! What was the last action or comedy movie you watched?. My Name is Dolemite. Did you like it? I personally thought it was pretty good.. I did too. I was glad to see Eddie Murphy in something good again.. Yes! I felt the exact same way.. Because of it, Netflix is finally making a 4th Beverly Hills Cop movie. One of my top favorite action comedy movies is the first one.. Wow I didn't know that. The first one is a classic.. The second one is awesome as well. However I did not like the 3rd one. Do you recommend any movies like it?. Hmmm. Have you seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang?. I've heard of it I think. Is that the one with Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr?. Yes. It's a fun dark comedy crime film also set in California.. That's sounds like a good one. Any other dark comedies you recommend?. In the same vein as that I'm a big fan of Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' and 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Very funny and plenty of action!. I don't think I've seen either of those although I feel like I should have. I know Lock Stock is referenced in some of the shows i have watched.. ", ". Hello! How can I help you today?. Hello. I am doing great. how are you?. I'm doing fine, thank you. What kind of movies do you like?. I like action movies. specifically ones that have comedy. Woah! I love those movies too! Have you seen Catch Me If You can with Leonardo DiCaprio?. I have! that is a great movie. It's one of my favorites. What was the last movie you watched?. Bad Boy 3 was the last movie I watched. Do you have a recommendation of an action movie that has comedy?. I would recommend Zombieland Double Tap. It has a lot of action and comedy, I would say 50% of both. I think that might be a great fit for you!. That sounds like a great idea! I saw the trailer. Yes, I accept your recommendation for Zombieland Double tap.

Have you seen any more recent movies that you enjoyed?. nice movie. Well, there's no doubt that action movies are a lot of fun and can tell a good story as well.. action and fun movie. Since you like Iron Man and action movies, I would recommend Avengers: Endgame. It includes Iron Man as well as a slew of other super heroes all teaming up to fight a common enemy. It's very exciting and fun. Would you like to view the trailer?. avengers endgame is a super movie. It sure is. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I think Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in it. As was Scarlett Johanssen.. Downey is a good actor. If you have already seen Avengers: Engame, would you like me to recommend a different movie?. jumanji the nex level. You would like to see a trailer for Jumanji The Next Level? Or is this another movie you enjoy?. spiderman home coming. ", ". Hello how are you?. I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary.. Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?. My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard.. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.. The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated?. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.. Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions?. Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore. I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train.. Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise. That sounds cool. What is that about?. It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him. It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists. Definitely sounds cool. I will definitely take a look. Sounds great! You've got two great movies to check out is there any other movie genre you want recommendations on? Or any movie you really like and want to watch something similar?. I would love to see a remake or something similar to Notting Hill. Julia Roberts fan as well.. I love movies like that! The first thing that comes to mind is Maid in Manhattan have you seen that before? it's not Julia Roberts but its a pretty similar storyline. I have seen it, Jennifer Lopez is awesome too. Critics do not give her enough credit. What is that new movie coming out of hers? The one where she is a stripper?. I just watched that yesterday! Hustlers its a really good movie I would recommend it. I agree they dont give her enough credit. That's It! I definitely want to see that! Is it still in theaters?. ", ". Hello, how are you doing?

Yeah I don't really like zombies. I feel it, what about aliens? I know Men in Black International came out not to long ago.. Not really of fan of aliens either. Nothing about space, zombies, dinosaurs.. Gotcha, have you seen the trailer for Booksmart?. No I haven't. What is it about?. You haven't?

It looked good and I am interesting in seeing this movie.. Have you seen the trailer for the new James Bond movie? I always see the newest Bond films.. I have not yet, but I am willing to consider seeing the James Bond film.. From what I see, it looks like a logical continuation of the Spectre theme - it has the Bond girl form the last file as well as the newest Blofield. I think this will be great.. hmmm that sounds good. that reminds me of the older james bond movie with sean connery- diamonds are forever. if you got the trailer, i would be willing to watch it.. Diamonds are forever was a classic. I do, however, like the newer films more. Less cynicism and more plausible. What do you think?. I agree. sometimes the remakes are just as good as the orginials..

But the new reboots have such a different story really. I think they are funnier than the first.. They can be funny to me thats a fact. I enjoy when Jack Black plays a girl, he is funny. I think I like the first one of the new reboot better than the second one that just came out. The animals in the first one seemed to be the stars of the movie, but in the new ones it's the stars..

Would you like one more recommendation just in case?. have you seen supersonic. ", ". Hi, I am here to help you look for movie trailer!. hello!. I'm going to start broadly--what kind of movies you like?. I usually like documentary films, or at least historically accurate drama films!. Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do.. That's great, I love documentaries! It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time. What's your favorite?. Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the Holocuast. The documentary is called Shoah.. That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary?. A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians.. That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation!. Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing.. That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries?. No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste.. That's too bad. I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans. But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like.. ", ". "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["No I haven't, but I'm familiar with it.

My favorite type of movie is murder/mystery.. Ooo those are fun! What's your favorite murder/mystery movie you've seen recently?. 21 Bridges. That's the same guy that plays in Black Panther, right? Did you like it?. Yes, it is Chadwick Boseman and the movie is absolutely great - it could be considers a Suspense/Thriller - Simply outstanding - produced by the Russo Brother who also worked with Chadwick on Black Panther.. If his acting is anywhere near as good as it is in Black Panther and the production is similar I'm sure it was great! I personally like a wide range of movies, just depends on how I'm feeling at the moment. Recently I've been watching more action movies.. Great! I tend to stay towards the Murder/Mystery.. Have you seen any other murder/mystery movies recently?. Yes, I recently watched a 1991 movie called Dead Again with Kenneth Branagh - I recommend this trailer and movie.. Hm, never heard of that. Have you ever seen In Darkness with Natalie Dormer? I absolutely love her as an actress ever since I saw her in Game of Thrones.. NO, I have not seen it. However, I just watched a trailer and it is one that I would want to see. It is a good recommendation based on what I saw.. I like that it has a good balance and keeps you on your toes! What is Dead Again about?. Dead Again is like a murder reincarnation as an amnesiac and a private investigator echos a 1940s murder case. You should check out a trailer.. I will definitely do that!. Since you have accepted my recommendation to check out the trailer and I took time to watch the trailer of your recommendation and it seems like a movie I would probably check out - is this chat basically over as I do not have any other recommendations?. ", ". Hi there im here to help you find a movie!. Hello, I love drama/ mystery movies. Do you have any recommendations?. sure do! whats the last mystery drama movie that you watched?. The last mystery movie I watched was Zodiac.. Zodiac was good, did you like it?. Yes, I did enjoy the movie... My favorite actor is Harrison Ford, I would like a recommendation on his recent movie instead. I can not remember the name of the movie.. Ah! I love Harrison Ford, His latest movie was Call of the Wild have you seen that one?. Yes, Call of the Wild. I would like to request a recommendation for that movie. I have not seen it. I have heard great reviews! Have you seen that one?. I havent just yet its still in the theaters too! It looks really good have you seen the trailer yet?.

What types of movies do you like?. i really like action/adventure movies, and i enjoy a good horror film too. do you have any suggestions?. I did just watch a horror movie called Midsommar with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd. You heard of it?. i have, and i've seen it too! i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time. i appreciate the cinematography though. since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations?. Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha. Anyways, other ones I liked recently were Joker (though most people have seen that haha), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Oldie but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be Blood (super weird and quite good). ohh, you know what, i haven't seen Joker yet but i've really been wanting to! i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently? No Country for Old Men is one i've been meaning to watch as well, thank you for the reminder, haha!. Oh nice! Yeah, I was late to the Joker train but it's fascinating movie. I know that a lot of hype can bring people into movies with inflated expectations but I went in knowing as little as possible and it really was great. Awesome atmosphere and great acting.. i try not to let the hype affect my expectations too much, but sometimes i can't help but hold a movie to a higher standard after a certain point. well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance!. Nice :). Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects. oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie..

Hi, so I hear your interested in movies. Yes, I am interested in movies.. What kind of movies do you like?. Action, Sci-Fi, Abstract, all kinds of different movies. Even some kids movies! Do you have any recommendations?. Yes, do you think you would like the irishman?. What is that about?. Its about the mafias involvement with the teamsters labor movement and politicians in Washington. Yes, that sounds like a movie I can get into. Do you have any others?. Hobbs & Shaw which is an action movie. The reason I asked is because I like to have options and choose from my options. I actually have heard good things about Hobbs & Shaw. I accept Hobbs & Shaw... Do you think you would like Fast & Furious 6, just like Hobbs and Shaw.. I'm sure I would. I'll have to check them both out and even the whole franchise. I would like something out of the box though. Do you have any good abstract, whoa movies, such as Intersteller?. indeed I do, would you like to see the trailer?. Yes, I would like to see the trailer.. great I have selected it so you should get it. That's great. I am excited to check it out. I appreciate it.. ", ". Hello, how are you doing today?. I'm doing well how about yourself?. I'm doing great. I was hoping to talk to you about movies. What kind of movies do you like?. I'm a big fan of movies in general. I'd say my favorite genres are comedies and action movies though.. Sounds good. See any good movies lately that you liked? Either in theater or at home?. I recently saw 1917 in theaters and really enjoyed it!. That movie was really good. I liked how they made a lot of the movie seem like it was a single shot. Really drew me into the action of it.. I agree! I also really enjoyed the acting. I thought the casting was perfect for the movie.. What kind of comedies do you like? Anything you've seen recently that was good?. I watched The Other Guys on Netflix last night before bed. It was hilarious!. Do you like other Will Ferrell movies?. I do! Do you have any other Will Ferrell movies you could recommend to watch?. I think if you liked The Other Guys you would really like Daddy's Home as well. Its Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg together and there are a lot of funny moments.. I did love the two of them together! I have not seen Daddy's Home either. Could you tell me a little about the plot?. ", ". Hi, I heard that you are looking for a movie to watch. I'd be happy to help!. Thanks! I like a little bit of everything, mostly comedies. I hate scary movies, though. I understand, I'm not the biggest fan of horror films either. Are you more into rom coms or general comedic films?. I usually like general comedic films more than rom coms, a movie that I really liked last year was Booksmart. I thought it was smart and really well done, I'm not usually one for cheesy movies.. Booksmart is a really great film! One film that I'd recommend checking out that has a similar vibe to it is The Edge of Seventeen. I'm not sure if you've seen it, but it has a solid female friendship behind it and explores themes of self-discovery during adolescence in a smart and funny way as well.. Great, I've heard of it. I'm going to check it out, thanks so much!. No problem, if you have any other questions about it , let me know!. Of course. Who is in the movie?.

I would recommend watching The Karate Kid if you haven't seen it yet! The 1984 version of the movie.. I have. I tend to shy away from remakes.

I'm sure you have the same opinon about GOT S8 right? haha Did you get a chance to see the rise of skywalker?. I've seen every one of them. I'm disappointed with how Skywalker ended. I mean... they're pretty much all dead! I've seen and liked both Fantastic Beasts, waiting for the 3rd. And to hell with whoever decided to kill Daenerys! lol.

Are you a fan of Denzel Washington?. Yes, I love Denzel Washington. He's a great actor.. haha I'm glad to hear it. Sometimes I feel like the younger generations aren't going to get actors like that. You know what I mean?. Yeah< i understand. My favorite movie of Denzel's is The Pelican Brief. My favorite movie genre is sci-fi. Have you seen any good sci-fi movies you would recommend?.

What's it about?. It's about a regime in the future who is arresting people before they actually commit their crimes. Then one of the leaders, is actually found guilty. Lot's of action, sci-fi, but has no real gore. Biggest thing to me is, they aren't just shooting people. It actually has a good story!. Sounds awesome! What's the name of the movie?. Well, I'd like to ask you two more questions, just to make sure it's the right one. Is that okay?. Yes, ask away.

Well the first, Maggie, isn't based on a true story (as previously discussed) but given our current events with the coronavirus, who's to say it couldn't happen? Lol.

I am here to help you look for a new movie to watch. Do you know of what kind of movie you are interested in?. Hello! I love comedies! Have you seen any good ones lately?. I am actually looking to possibly go see the movie Jumanji; The next level. Looks really good and has a really good cast in it.. Oh I had no idea there was another Jumanji movie out! That sounds awesome! Who is in the cast?. Big actors such as, Dwayne Johnson (the rock), Kevin Hart. They are huge actors and always bring a real comical approach to movies.. I love them both! Sounds like a good one to see! Thank you for the recommendation!. You definitely welcome! You should check out the trailer for that movie. It's really funny!. I will defintely do that now! Thanks! I def accept the recommendation and will go check the trailer for it now! Thank you so much!. you are welcome. Glad I could help you.. I just hope it is playing this weekend, I need a good excape of reality and a good laugh as well! lol. yes it is suppose to be hilarious.. Any other movies you can recommend in case that one is out? Have you seen the new Christmas movie thats out? I apologize, I cant think of the name. This one comes out next week. December 13th. There is another Christmas movie that comes out the same day as Jumanji called Black Christmas. Are you thinking of that one?. No, I don't think thats it.. Its more of a romantic comedy I believe . My daughter wants to see it.. ", ". Hello! How are you today?. I'm fine thanks. How are you?. I'm doing well. I'm going to try to help you find a cool movie today. What kind of movies do you like?. I love romantic comedies. Romantic comedies are awesome! Have you ever seen 500 Days of Summer?. Yeah. It was alright. That's one of my favorites. Which one is your current favorite?. We're the millers. I love Jennifer Aniston! Have you seen The Switch?. The switch was fantastic. Jenniefer was a revelation. I totally agree. I love Jason Bateman too, he's such a dad and absolutely hilarious. Have you seen Juno?. I haven't seen that one. What's it about?. It came out in like 2007 so it's a little older but it's about this teenage girl who accidentally gets pregnant by one of her best friends, and then how she deals with the aftermath of that. I don't want to spoil it and I know it sounds cheesy but it's actually really sweet and super funny and not at all what you would probably expect out of a teen pregnancy movie.. I'd really like to see it. It sounds interesting. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help recommend a movie for you.. Oh, alright. So, I am thinking about something that maybe is thought-provoking but also has fantasy elements.. What's one movie you liked that was similar to this?. Ok, so, I really like MCU and Pixar movies.. So you like more superhero and/or a decidedly good vs. evil kind of though provoking fantasy?. Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it.. Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception. It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie.. Oh yeah that movie is great.. Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige?. Not yet, but I'm intersted..

Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together.. Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see?. We both like action movies :). Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ?. The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little.... Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. Yes, a similar one please :). I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead.. We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it?. okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray. Yes please :). Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties.. Of course :). while I'm waiting I want to see what other movies especially comedy do yall like?. We saw the sequel to Zombieland recently! I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it! Especially the midcredit scene :P. I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first.. I think if Zombieland: Double Tap came out first, though, It would be the favorite... Like if the movies were to flip dates our opinions would be different.. It sounds like they would be if they were. I'm going to attempt to send the movie trailer again.. Okay cool. I try not to have high hopes with sequels just as I try to separate books from their movies and pretend they are both their own thing.. They definitely leave a lot out in the movies compared to some books.. Any luck with the link?. I can't get birds of prey, I can get warm bodies, ouija, and the duff. Ooh, I've always wanted to see warm bodies!. ", ". Hey, how's it going!. hello, going good. seen any good movies lately?. yeah, I saw historical documentry. nice, what name? I liked Thin Blue Line, though that's more of a documentary about recent things. hey I watched that onlyrecently.Do u know any historical movies like that??. could think of a couple, Herzog has a few documentaries about actual events given a similarly empathetic twist. No.Am looking for some historical movie with action. titicut follies has some action, children of darkness too. ohh, that's nice i will see that movie. are there any other types of movies you like?. i like action movies also. i think i can recommend something. Sure, is there any good good action movies do you know. mission impossible with tom cruise is good. I saw that all parts already.. baby driver's pretty nice. ohh , may I know the ratings for that movie. ", ". Hello, my name is Jay, and i have noticed that you're looking for a movie recommendaton?.

I started watching Traitors on Netflix, which was produced by BBC 4. It's about a women working as a spy and trying to find a communist mole in the UK right after WW2.

Would you like to watch a movie that is a romantic comedy?. Yeah, I'll definitely be willing to hear your recommendation(s).. To All the Boys I Loved Before is a very sweet film with some cute comedy involved. It's a Netflix original that will have your heart melted and also, tears from laughing so much. I remember watching this with my partner and it really was enjoyable for the two of us. In addition, Noah Centineo is an upcoming actor himself. I've been seeing him in a couple of shows and movies after watching this one!. That sounds like it would be up my alley. Thank you for taking the time out to explain what the movie is about and your recommendation. I will most definitely be checking it out!. Awesome to hear!. Any other movies I should check out?. Another movie to definitely check out is, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. It is a bit older than the first one I recommended, however, it is star-studded with Zac Efron and Adam Devine. It's almost a given that it will be another great movie to watch as Zac Efron steals hearts and Adam Devine has a huge comedian side to him. Super cute and funny to watch!. That's not too old. People give Zac Efron a lot of flack, but I think he's usually a good fit for a comedy.. ", ". Hey there! I hear you're interested in movies. May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy?. Absolutely!

I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field. 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?. I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money.

Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. I generally like any movie genre, but I would say I prefer action. What is the last movie that you watched?. Last movie was Pelham 123. Okay, that was with Denzel Washington. If you haven't seen it yet I would recomment the Equalizer II movie trailer? It is an action movie.. Yea sure, that sounds good. Great! You will enjoy Denzel Washington in this movie.. Nice, cant wait. there is also the first movie Equalizer along with Man on Fire also with Denzel Washington. Ive seen both of those. Safe House, American Gangster, Faller, Unstoppable are Action movies as well. Sure Safe House sounds good. Safe Hluse had 7 nominations and won 1 award. It should be a satisfying movie experience. Great that sounds good, cant wait to watch it. Don't forget the popcorn, enjoy!. Already have it ready!. Do you have a specific actor you enjoy watching for your action movies?. I grew up watching alot of Jason Statham movies. So id say I like his movies the most. What about you?. Bruce Willis and his many Die Hard movies. I especially enjoyed Tom Cruise in his 3 Mission Impossible movies? Have you seen any of these. I have not seen any of the Die Hard movies, but I love Bruce Willis's movies. Ive seen all of Tom Cruises mission impossibles. I really liked Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies.. I haven't seen Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher movies, Bruce Willis also has a action, comedy movie called Venice made in 2017 so it hasnt been made that long ago. He is still out there.. You should defenitley give the Jack Reacher movies a watch. They are very good. I havent really seen anything by Bruce Willis in about the past 10 years. Ive seen most of his movies from the 90's and early 00's. Pulp fiction is my favorite, which made me like Travolta. Travolta's from Paris with Love is one of my favorites from him, have you seen it?. The most recent movie with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson working alongside each other is GLASS. Just arrived in 2019.Would you like to see this movie trailer?. Yea sure. Is that the movie that was a sequel to the movie Split?. I havent seen Travolta's movie. Glass and Split are made by the same director and have similar story lines but i dont see where they are a sequel thought it is possible.. Ah ok that movies another you should watch. I thought Glass would be a sequel to it cause it looked the same character was in that movie as well. I haven't seen either so thats how I made the assumption. I just watched the trailer for Glass.. Yes, it is the sequel after reading futher. I hope you will enjoy the recommendations and have a great movie night. Good day to you.. Thank you, I wish you the same.

The actors?. The action, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him..

Hi, I'm here to help you pick a movie trailer.. Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind?. Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from.. I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up.. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary.. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?. This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright.. I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different?. It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was Ready or Not which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best!. Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend?. I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy.. Thank you so much!. My pleasure to help you with your choices.. I look forward to seeing it!. There are so many horror movies being released compared to years ago and, happily, the quality has improved. As a horror fan. myself. I'm thrilled.. A horror movie will make or break within the first 15 minutes or so for me. I never finish movies for the sake of it but I'm also fairly forgiving about cliche.. I agree. If I'm not starting to stress during that time or at least become aware that somethings coming then I've tuned out.. I can recognize traditional scare tactics pretty well in this genre. If you have seen enough of them, it gets that way.. ", ". Hey its, Kiki how are you??. Hello Kiki! I am well, you?. I am well thank you. So I am looking to go to the movies and I need something new.

Well, with the virus, I'd love something a little more lighthearted I guess. One of my favorite movies is What We Do in the Shadows, so do you know anything in that vein?. That's the vampire movie, right? Do you want to stick with lighthearted vampire fun, or just cheesy fantasy in general?. Yeah, it's like a mockumentary about vampires, it's hilarious. Cheesy fantasy works for me, or anything with Taika Waititi, honestly.. Have you seen Jojo Rabbit yet?. I haven't.. It's directed by Tika Waititi and is a comedy set in Nazi era Germany.. That sounds like a great recommendation. Thanks! I'll take a look.. I think you'll really like it. It got a 7.1 on IMDB and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.. Have you heard whether it's funny or not?. It's a mix of really funny and a little tragic. But I guess it's hard not to have a little tragedy when you're talking about WW2 and Hitler. How do you feel about Scarlett Johansson?. Ha, that's true enough. I think she's ok. A little overrated, but better than most.. Taika Waititi plays Hitler, too.. That sounds pretty great.. Would you like to see the trailer?.

What would you recommend ?. I was honestly really impressed with Uncut Gems. Its a crime/mystery about a NYC jeweller who has a serious gambling problem.. Sounds interesting.I will give it a try. Thanks for the recommendation !. Adam Sandler has done a great job in this movie playing as a jeweler. He is neck deep in debt and people are always after him trying to get their money back but my boy Adam Sandler spends more money on gambling risking his life along with his family's future. Very tense movie man, keeps you on the edge the whole time. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. What year was it made?. end of 2019, there was this big fuss about how it got snubbed for oscar. Do you have any recommendations for space movies?. First Man, my favorite space movie of all time. It's about how Neil Armstrong joins the space program, spending years in training and risking his life during test flights. And finally their journey to moon. It's a very personal movie, gives you insight into his life.. When was it released?. First Man, released in 2018. It's about how Neil Armstrong joins the space program, spending years in training and risking his life during test flights. And finally their journey to moon. It's a very personal movie, gives you insight into his life.. Is it entertaining or slow paced?. ", ". Hi my name is KK what is yours. KM! Nice to meet you. What type of movies do you like KM. I'm into all kinds of movies. Usually action, but I like comedy movies and serious dramas too.. Ah I like romantic comedy the best.. Romantic Comedy is a good genre. The wife and I watch those together often.. is there a particular actor you like?. Not necessarily. I'm open to any actors as long as they are decent. DeCaprio, Hanks, Smith..Pitt, any of them are always pretty watchable.. What was the last action movie you saw?. I just finished watching World War Z with Brad Pitt, although I've seen it a few dozen times! The last action movie would probably have been Skyscraper with The Rock. They were both great movies. mine was frozen 2 haha. Ahh, you probably have little ones. My daughter was into the original frozen, but has NO interest in Frozen 2..she's WAY too cool for it, lol.. nope my kids are now older but it was enjoyable. I may have to watch it..I'll probably end up watching it eventually, no way to avoid all these disney movies, lol. exactly! Do you enjoy going to the movies and seeing new releases or on TV (a home). I usually watch releases at home, but I do like to go to the fancy Dolby Theater for big releases, like Avengers.. ", ".

Okay, that was with Denzel Washington. If you haven't seen it yet I would recomment the Equalizer II movie trailer? It is an action movie.. Yea sure, that sounds good. Great! You will enjoy Denzel Washington in this movie.. Nice, cant wait. there is also the first movie Equalizer along with Man on Fire also with Denzel Washington. Ive seen both of those. Safe House, American Gangster, Faller, Unstoppable are Action movies as well. Sure Safe House sounds good. Safe Hluse had 7 nominations and won 1 award. It should be a satisfying movie experience. Great that sounds good, cant wait to watch it. Don't forget the popcorn, enjoy!. Already have it ready!. Do you have a specific actor you enjoy watching for your action movies?.

I especially enjoyed Tom Cruise in his 3 Mission Impossible movies? Have you seen any of these. I have not seen any of the Die Hard movies, but I love Bruce Willis's movies. Ive seen all of Tom Cruises mission impossibles. I really liked Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies.. I haven't seen Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher movies, Bruce Willis also has a action, comedy movie called Venice made in 2017 so it hasnt been made that long ago. He is still out there.. You should defenitley give the Jack Reacher movies a watch. They are very good. I havent really seen anything by Bruce Willis in about the past 10 years. Ive seen most of his movies from the 90's and early 00's. Pulp fiction is my favorite, which made me like Travolta. Travolta's from Paris with Love is one of my favorites from him, have you seen it?. ", ".

I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind.. That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks!. No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems.. Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies. Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character.. OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing!. ", ". Hi there! What kinds of movies do you like to watch?. I'm a big fan of science fiction and action movies. What's good right now?. Are you more into serious action or comedic action?. Probably more action comedy. Movies like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour where there's a lot of action, but also some great laugh lines.. There's a new Bad Boys coming out in January. The first two were very much in the Lethal Weapon/Rush Hour school of action.. Oh yeah! I remember seeing a couple of trailers for that. That's perfect. I accept this recommendation.. Excellent! I hope you enjoy the film.. Me too. Will Smith's been in a bunch of good movies lately, so hopefully this one's good too.. I'm looking forward to Spies in Disguise, his new animated movie. That could also be an action comedy, though I get more comedy than action.. Yeah, I feel like Spies in Disguise is more of a kids' movie. Not that that's a bad thing, just not quite my thing.. Did you see either of the previous Bad Boys movies?. Yes. I enjoyed them both. I think Bad Boys is a good recommendation.. What other types of movies do you enjoy?. Science fiction! Serenity, Star Trek, that sort of thing.. How do you feel about Star Wars?. Well, I have a son that we named Luke. Does that give you an idea?:). Excellent choice of name! I'll take it you've already got Rise of Skywalker on your calendar. Definitely. The Last Jedi was pretty awful, but I'm hoping with JJ Abrams back at the helm, this one will be better.. The part that got me in that one was the Leia/Mary Poppins bit.. Lol, I hadn't thought of it that way. Now I won't be able to unthink it. Argh. For me it was mostly that the whole central conflict of the movie chase could have been avoided if Admiral Holdo wasn't a terrible commander.. Let's see what happens in this next one.

I haven't seen that movie yet sounds fun from the way you described it. It's similar to Sonic, it's a cartoon and is all age friendly! Also full of comedy and action.. I've also enjoyed playing the games from the franchise, perhaps I'll give it a shot.. Would you like anymore options?. I will try the angry birds movie first. Thanks for your reccomendation!.

I saw a trailer for Avator recently. A sci-fi fantasy genre that looked very interesting and beautiful special effects.. ", ". Hello, how are you today?. I am very well.

I like dramas like gangster and war movies. I also like comedies but humor is so subjective.. I also watched Road House this past week. It is an older movie. The longer I watched it, the more I realized they would never produce a movie like that nowadays. Do you have a favorite movie? Mine, I would have to say is Dances with Wolves.. It's been a long time since I've seen Road House. I like so many that I can't pick a favorite. I love The Thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Fright Night, Goodfellas, Platoon. Recently I really enjoyed Joker and Doctor Sleep.. Two of my favorite actors are in Road House. Sam Elliott and Patrick Swayze! You know, you said you like horror. Have you watched the Ring? That movie gave me the creeps. If you haven't seen it, the movie trailer will give you a good idea of what it is about.. I have but only the original Japanese one and the American remake. None of the sequels. I like Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski a lot.. How about Paranormal Activity? Would you like to see the trailer for that movie? It was creepy!. I have seen that one. It was very creepy. I know some people don't like hand held or shaky cam movies but it never bothered me.. ", ". hello how are you.. great how are you?. I am good. Thank you. Can I help you with selecting a movie today?. Yes I am looking for a movie with a lot of action and violence.. Great! Do you have a preference to older or newer movies ?. older movies please.

My favorite type of movie is murder/mystery.. Ooo those are fun! What's your favorite murder/mystery movie you've seen recently?. 21 Bridges. That's the same guy that plays in Black Panther, right?

Yes, it is Chadwick Boseman and the movie is absolutely great - it could be considers a Suspense/Thriller - Simply outstanding - produced by the Russo Brother who also worked with Chadwick on Black Panther.. If his acting is anywhere near as good as it is in Black Panther and the production is similar I'm sure it was great! I personally like a wide range of movies, just depends on how I'm feeling at the moment. Recently I've been watching more action movies.. Great! I tend to stay towards the Murder/Mystery.. Have you seen any other murder/mystery movies recently?. Yes, I recently watched a 1991 movie called Dead Again with Kenneth Branagh - I recommend this trailer and movie.. Hm, never heard of that. Have you ever seen In Darkness with Natalie Dormer? I absolutely love her as an actress ever since I saw her in Game of Thrones.. NO, I have not seen it. However, I just watched a trailer and it is one that I would want to see. It is a good recommendation based on what I saw.. I like that it has a good balance and keeps you on your toes! What is Dead Again about?. Dead Again is like a murder reincarnation as an amnesiac and a private investigator echos a 1940s murder case. You should check out a trailer.. I will definitely do that!.

I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list.. I would have to agree with you on this.

While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot.. I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting.. You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!. Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?. The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!. Thanks for that information. I am definitely interested in this and accept your recommendation.. ", ". hello how are you?. i am good ..how are you?. i am great, what kind of movies do you like?.

Hello from across the miles. hello!. so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation?. thats correct! Can you help?. Of Course ! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like ? what genre if I may ask ?... I typically like action movie! bUt ones that make you think, not just ones with a lot of explosions. What was the last movie you watched ? either rented of went to the theatre.. I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that. ", ". Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes. Truly one of Keanu Reeves' best movies since the Matrix trilogy in my opinion.. I dont think i have seen those before, what genre are they?. I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times.. okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre?. I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind.. That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks!. No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems.. Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies. Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character.. OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing!.

I think you might like it. I have not seen Irishman, but I'm a fan of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I'll have to check that out. Would you refer a movie that's on netflix?. Sure if you want.

I dislike horror films, can you recommend anything else?. Sure. Have you seen Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. It's a 1988 film staring Antonia Banderas. Its about a series of heightened womanly dilemmas, with a little bit of sexual politics added in. That sounds great. I haven't seen it. I will check it out.. Something a little more light hearted is Klown its a 2012 film with a little bit of HBO's Curb your Enthusiasm added in.. Okay, cool. I like Curb Your Enthusiasm. I'll check it out, thanks!. And if you are looking for something that can pull at your heart strings, I would also recommend My Life as a Dog, from Sweden. Its a coming of age movie, very thought provoking. It goes into childhood wonder and how we have to realize the inevitable as we grow up, such as how to deal with death and heartache.. Oh, cool, I heard that is good. Have you seen Babylon Berlin on Netflix? I thought it was pretty good. It's about crime in Weimar Germany. It's in my queue, actually. Thank you for the recommendation! I'll have to watch that!. Yeah, I thought the design and costumes were really good. Apparently it was one of the most expensive Netflix films ever to produce. Seriously!? Wow! I just finished the Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, oh my goodness, grab tissues if you want to watch that.. That sounds interesting as well. That was such a crazy story. Such a sad ending for someone who seemed to have it all.. Have you seen Bridesmaids staring Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and a few others?. Yes, really funny. I love both Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph as actresses. I only recently realized Maya's mom was singer Minnie Riperton. ", ". How are you. I am good, and you?. I am doing ok.

I like old movies. As far as comedy I would pick Police Academy old but very funny. On the drama side I would say The notebook. What is Police Academy about, I've never heard of in it. Any known actors?. I am not sure how old you are but Steve Guttenberg and Kim Cattral are in it. Move is about a group of misfits and how they join a Police Academy and it follows them in training and later in job as cops on the streets.. Yes, I am familiar with Kim Cattral. Sound like a great reccomendation! I will definitely watch! Thak you!!!. This had few movies but start with 1st one for sure. Can't wait to see it! Thanks. on the current day I would say Schitt's Creek. What is that about? Sounds pretty awkward lol. This is a show about a rich family that got rubbed by the accountant and they are forced to go live in a tiny town that they purchased as a joke. They live in a motel. But you have to hear them talk and follow the life in this town. I am watching this for a second time in a year and love every minute of it.. Oh wow, sound interesting!.

Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together.. Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see?. We both like action movies :). Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ?. The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little.... Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. Yes, a similar one please :). I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead.. We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it?. okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray. Yes please :). Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties.. Of course :). ", ". Hey there! How are you?. hi I am fine and you?. I'm well! I came to talk to you about your favorite movies. Do you have any?. yes I do. Star Trek, adventure movies and comedies especially.. And so would you say your favorite genre is more action or sci-fi?. today it is more sci-fi on my mind.. Sci-Fi is great! And have you seen nay of those genre movies in the theaters lately?. no last movie I saw was and an adventure one about cars. Isn't there a new one about space?. There are a few new ones about space. I am about to find some good movies in this genre for you that have been nominated.. Has one been nominated for best picture?. Yes, After Earth has been highly acclaimed. It is a space and sci fi movie you would love. Have you heard of it?. Yes and it sounds interesting. I think you have found a movie I can get into with interest. Thank you.. ", ". Hello. hey there. Do you like movies and if so what kind do you like?. I mainly like horror movies and comedies.

Loved that one a lot. Are there any actors/actresses you really like?. Bill Murray is great.. Have you seen the movie Zombieland? Bill Murray makes a cameo and it has some humor.. I have seen it.

That director, who's name I forget, also directed Get Out a couple of years ago. Another fantastic film.. I see you like suspense, I can recommend the movie Midsommar. It was colorful but also scary.. Oh, I haven't seen that one. I'll check it out - thank you!. Do you like Sci-fi movies?. Yes, I do.. I'd recommend you watch a trailer for Midsommar.. I accept your recommendation. Thank you.. If you like Sci-fi movies with lots of suspense and drama, I would also recommend Snowpiercer. Like Parasite, it is also a Korean director..

For recent movies, I really like Sully, the true story about when a pilot landed a plane on The Hudson River in New York in 2009, in freezing conditions. The 2 minute trailer for it on YouTube is also very exciting.. I have not seen that one. I will have to check it out. thank you. have you seen the movie what dreams may come? my son and I were actually talking about it yesterday. its a movie from 1998 but the graphics are very vibrant and rich. The concept of the movie is very unique which is something that I enjoy. I get tired of watching movies that have the same concepts but with different actors.. I've heard of that movie, with Robin Williams. I have it on my list of movies I want to see. Your husband will enjoy Sully. It's a movie you can watch parts of over and over, because of the tension and drama of landing the plane.. I will check out the trailer for the movie. Do you have any other recommendations? I worry about the movie being about landing a plane only because my husband was in the military and has some ptsd so I have to be careful with what we watch. He doesn't do well with military, helicopters, war or planes.. Maybe a non-action drama would be better. I highly recommend Spotlight about The Boston Globe and their investigative efforts. No action, just people working hard.. Thank you I am sure that we both would enjoy that movie. Thank you for your help I feel good about that movie it sounds very interesting and something the whole family can enjoy.. I have selected Spotlight on the left. It shows some details about it.. I will definitely check it out. thank you for your help. is there any other movie you would suggest. ", ". Hello, I hope you're having a good day today.. Hey! You as well, how's it going? Any good movie recommendations?. Well, are you into history at all?. Definitely! Depending on the type of movie, I more like action and comedy, but if it's like an uplifting history movie I can definitely be into it!. I love comedies also! And if you're into action movies, I highly recommend the John Wick series. It is just jammed packed with stuff happening for the first minute right now do the end.. Okay great! I've heard of those, do you like all of them in the series? There's three, right?. Yes, there are three. I admit, my favorite is the first one, as is the case with most movie series.

Great, thanks for asking! I hope I can find you a good movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie you'd like to see?. I like romantic comedies best, but I also like movies based on true events.. What was the last romantic comedy you watched?. The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler. He's one of my favorites. The music is always great in his movies.. Cool! Haven't seen that one in forever. So are you looking for something similar?. Yes! I like that endearing hopefulness, with the really sweet, good guy. You know the kind, where love just sort of sneaks up on them!. Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz?. I like them both! They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals.. If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it. It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though. I can tell you more about it if you'd like.. I've heard some really good reviews about that one. I'd love to hear more about it. And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please.. Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true.. So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level.. She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc.... Cool--sounds interesting. I'd love to watch it. I accept your recommendation!. There's also a little band that sort of breaks the third wall and plays throughout the story, I always thought that was kind of neat. The supporting cast is really good too, Matt Dillon and Lee Evans have great side characters competing for Mary's affection. Great, I'll link the trailer is just a moment.. Okay--I'll wait. I do enjoy a story that has little sidelines in it!. ", ". Hello, how are you?. Hi. I'm doing alright. It's been a relaxing weekend. How about you?. It's quiet here.

It's like the 1990s' Real World that was on MTV but it is like a slow drama reality show with good audio and celebrity Japanese hosts who make funny commentaries. It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of The Exception. I will check it out.. ", ". Hello how are you?.

I am here to help you look for a movie trailer!. Hi! I'm looking forward to watching something new. What do you recommend?. What kind of movies do you like?. I like fantasy action/adventure movies. Oh I do too!! Are you interested in marvel or DC or more like Harry Potter?. I love all of those! Though Marvel movies have been better the last few years than DC. I have seen many DC movies but love Marvel! Have you seen Endgame yet?. Yes. The scene where all the supers came back made me teary, but when they showed spidey, i full on cried lol. Lol!! I almost cried during that scene too!. I wish the spiderman movies were on Disney+. I didnt realize they werent!. Yeah they aren't on there. I guess the problems between Disney and Sony kept them off but I'm not completely sure why.. Thats sad. Have you seen the Black Panther movie?. Yes I did. It was great! I would love a panther movie from the past, like earlier in Wakanda's timeline. That would be awesome!! I think one of my favorites is Ant man. I haven't seen Ant-Man yet, or the Guardians movies. Not even Ant Man and Wasp?. Nope. I chose not to watch it because I missed the first one.. You should definitely check out the first one! Its an amazing story of a man tries to turn his life around because of his little girl. Its a little different than the other marvel movies but so good!. Sounds good! I will definitely watch it.. ", ". hello. hi there. So what movies have you seen lately?. I've last seen the Irishman and Once upon a time in Hollywood.. Are those your favorite type of movies?. I usually prefer action movies. Is there an actor you like best?. I would probably have to say Denzel Washington. Have you seen The Equalizer?. No I haven't.. would you like to watch the trailer?. Yes I would.. ok. there is also a sequel.. That's perfect I would probably enjoy them both.. It is a little older of a movie, but a good one.. I don't mind that. Sometimes older movies are better.. Okay I will let you watch the trailer. Thank you.. you are welcome!. Look's very intriguing, maybe you could offer me more suggestions.. ", ". hi!. Hi. what kinds of movies do you see in the theater, versus watching at home?. Hmm...I like seeing movies with friends in theaters whereas at home I prefer just to watch by myself. Usually in theaters it is a big blockbuster or something recent.. that big screen is a definite for big blockbusters! i take it action is your thing then? are you into the comic book movies that are popular now?. Not really into comic book based moveis. More into space or time travel movies.. oh yea! interstellar is a personal favorite of mine. have you seen donnie darko before? jake gyllenhaal is pretty young in it. I really liked interseller and donnie darko is one of my favorite films. Are there others like them you would recommend?. of course! time travel movies tend to fall on the funny or serious side, it sounds like a more serious one is up your alley. edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it?. I am not, though I like tom cruise movies.. this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about). Interesting. Did the movie have different names in different markets?. yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt. lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others?. looper is about time travelling to kill people (it's not as dark as that sounds), its a really interesting take on time travel with bruce willis and joseph gordon-levitt. not a spoiler, but joseph gordon-levitt plays a younger version of bruce willis. I saw looper and really liked it. Looper is a good recommendation. I also liked inception. Are there anymore like that?. cant mention time travel assassins without bringing up terminator or terminator 2...a real interesting take on the action/futuristic space genre is hardcore henry, the entire movie is shot first person. Oh, I hadn't thought of looking back that far. I'll check out both terminator and terminator 2. I accept your recommendation.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Watch the trailer!

I last watched Lord of the Rings. have you seen it?. I have, I loved how they kept close to the book without losing that movie magic. Oh yeah definitely I love that kind of movie. Any others like it that you know?. *books, did you enjoy the lore or the gore more?. A little of each I suppose. I have only read the hobbit but that was a classic. Any recommendations for me to watch tonight?. If you want a more family friendly movie with lots of magic and backstory I would recommend the Spiderwick Chronicles. oh yeah, whats it about?. it's a family who moves into a house filled with trolls, fairies, and have to protect themselves from them. hmm, sounds right up my alley. thanks for the recommendation I will check it out. Have a good one!. you too, thank you!. while were here any books you recommend?. The lion, the witch, and the wardrobe series were written by an author who worked at Cambridge or Oxford with the writer of the Hobbit. I like that one. You have any good new music you come across?. ", ". Hi! How are you?. Hello. I'm doing great how are you?. Good! Thanks! What types of movies do you like?. I like all kinds of movies but my favorites are action and comedies. Have you heard about the new Zombieland movie? It sounds like it would fit you perfectly! It's a comedy and action film.. Yeah I remember seeing trailers for it back when it was released. I don't know why I never went to see it. You should check it out! It's available on Youtube, Google Play, Prime Video, and Vudu for less the $5!. Are there any other movies that blend comedy and action like Zombieland?. My favorite action/comedy movies are the DeadPool series! You should check those out!. Yeah I loved the first one. I haven't seen part 2 yet though. Is it as good as the first one?. I loved it! All of my friends did too! It's just as good, if not better!. Awesome I think I will check that one out too.. ", ". Hi there! Can I help recommend any movies for you?. Yes. I like movies that are comedies. Have you seen any good ones recently?. I have! Do you have any favorite comedy actors?. Yes, Chris Rock, Owen Wilson, Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell, Steve Martin. I'm sure there are others also lol.. Haha, those are some classic funny guys. One more question then I think I have some recommendations. You watching with any kids or just adult comedies?. Just adult comedies.. One I have enjoyed with Will Farrell is The Other Guys. Hilarious cop comedy with him and Mark Wahlberg.. Yes, I love that one! It's very funny.. It is! I assume you have already seen Step Brother as well. Have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. I actually haven't seen either of them. But since they made a sequel, the first was probably pretty good. Thank you for those recommendations. I will check them out.. Cool! I am send you a trailer for the first one so you can make sure it's the one for you.. Ok, thank you.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["The new Frozen 2 soundtrack is great. Have you seen it?", "Great!

Do you girls prefer rom-com, mystery, horror? I know my BFF and I really enjoy a good horror movie from time to time.. I love horror movies too!! And so does she. Oh thats fantastic! May I ask, What is the last horror movie you enjoyed?. I cant remember the name of it. but it was about a couple that got married, and his family wanted to play hide and seek in this big mansion. I believe the movie you are referring to is Ready or Not. Considering the time of year, would you enjoy a Holiday Horror?. Yes, absolutely!!. I believe I have the perfect movie trailer recommendation for you! And to cause a little dramatic effect, I will tell you... next!. Okay......What is it?!. My movie trailer selection for you is Krampus. Krampus, okay I've not heard of that yet, but I'll give it a try. I accept your recommendation. Thank you for your help.. Have a great day! Enjoy!. is Krampus a new movie or has it been out a while?. is came out in 2015.. oh, okay that must be why its not ringing a bell. ", ". Hi! I have seen several movies lately that I would recommend.. I love movies and would love to hear your recommendations.. If you like mystery/whodunit movies, I would recommend Knives Out. It has a great cast, twist and turns, and a bit of dark comedy.. I did see Knives Out and I definitely enjoyed it. I do enjoy a mystery. I also enjoy horror, drama, and comedy. I watcha lot of movies but some have certainly fallen through the cracks for me.. Glad you enjoyed it too. Wow, so you appreciate many genres! Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler. I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate.. I am aware of that one but have not seen it. I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure.. I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it.. I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it?. Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it.. Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about?. Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them.. I am familiar with them. Judd Hirsh is a very good actor.. Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days! Yes, I am that old!. Ha ha. I'm somewhere in between. I saw it when I was very, very young.. Well i hope you take me up on my recommendation and see Uncut Gems, if only to see Sandler's amazing performance.. You have convinced me. I would like to see it now and am sure I will soon.. Great! Enjoy the rest of your day!. Thank you. I would definitely like to see the trailer for Uncut Gems..

What kind of movies do you like?. horror, love, fantasy. Hmmm- Do you often go to the movies. yes, I love going to the movies when they first come out. Ok So you enjoy opening night. yes but there are some times that its good to go on the last night that they are in the theater. What was the last movie you saw. impractical jokers. Have you seen Zombieland?. yes I think it is a great movie, it is very comical. I Love woody Harrelson-. Emma Stone is a really good actress, I love how her and her sister keep stealing the boys car. Yes- Unfortunatly we are all stuck home because of Covid 19. I agree but it gives people time to watch movies or netflix, there are some really good movies on netflix and I have all the Harry Potter movies. I love watching them. Yes- Netflix- I can get caught up on some films i have missed. There are some good films but also series that are really good, I am watching The Office right now but have watched a number of really good movies and series on Netflix. I loved the show Once Upon a Time it brings back all the disney characters that you knew when you were a kid and is really good.. I loved the book and I really want to see when I can Call of the Wild. never seen it but would love to watch it, I like watching new things. I have been trying to watch everything I have watched many random movies and some that you think would suck turned out to be really good movies.. The movie is based on a novel by Jack London- sometimes the novel does not translate well in the movie- Harrison Ford is a great actor- looking forward to it. my fiance said that it was a good movie he was telling me some information about it and said that it is a really good movie to watch. I recently just watched Lock and Key on Netflix and it was surprisingly good. I thought that it would be boring but it was really interesting. I think you should go with your fiance- it will not be boring- and it will give you two to have a nice evening out and not be stuck at home. Once this whole covid 19 is gone I would love to go watch it. Another one that I really wanted to see in the movies was Fantasy Island that one looked like it would be good.. Yes once we can get out again- I have seen the Fantasy Island trailer-Also Greyhound with Tom Hanks looks good-. never heard of greyhound, what did you think of Fantasy Island. Fantasy Island sounds like fun- I saw the trailer to that also. The late 70's tv show was very lame- I was a kid then. movies aren't like they were back when we were younger. You may like Greyhound it is a true story against the odds theme-. thank you I accept your recommendation and am excited to watch it. Cool- you guys have fun. thanks you too hope this Covid 19 passes and you can get out to the movies.. Yes in NYC so we are stressed about it- anyway have fun.

I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list.. I would have to agree with you on this.

While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot.. I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting.. You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!. Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?. The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!. Thanks for that information.

I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types.

Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s..

I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you.

I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie. Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan?. Huh, really? Well, not that one either, what is it about?. It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less. The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think. Hmm, do you have another Nolan movie in mind?. Since you like MCU movies, I'm assuming you've seen The Dark Knight trilogy, but if not I'd really recommend those even if you aren't a DC fan..

He recommends new indie horror movies to his fans, I'd recommend checking out The Autopsy of Jane Doe.. I loved the autopsy of jane doe it was one of my favorite new horror films. It's the #1 recommendation. I'd also recommend Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch 2. I havent seen Blair Witch 2 but I was not a big fan of the first one. Yeah, if you didn't enjoy the first one I'd stay away from it too. Have you seen STIR OF ECHOES?. I dont think I have, Kevin Bacon right?. Yes! It's a supernatural film based on a novel. I remember you said you like sci fi movies and this is based on a novel like Stephen King so it could be a good one to check out.. I will check out a trailer for it thanks I accept this recomenndation. Awesome! I'd also check out Stir of Echoes: The Homecoming, it came out in 2007 and is a thriller..

Another one you may like is Hereditary, which is by the same director.

Just preparing everything to go back to work tomorrow. How about you?. I'm good. Just came back from the theatre. I hear you need some help in selecting a movie to see.. I would indeed. I was hoping that you may have some ideas on a good movie to see.. What type of film do you usually like?. I have several genre's that I like. I enjoy comedies that aren't silly dumb. I also like everyday neighbor type movies.. Well, along the lines of the last one, there is A beautiful day in the neighborhood. Its about Mr. Rogers.. Hmmm. Who is in that one?. He had a famous childrens show for a while. But he was apparantly a really interesting person in real life. It got great reviews and stars Tom Hanks.. Oh, I usually like Tom Hanks. I remember a little bit about Mr. Rogers. Is it a comedy or more of a biography?. It is a biography. But its funny.. It sounds like something that I would enjoy. I will accept your recommendation.. Cool. But before you go...I just rewatched There's something about Mary. Its a classic comedy...if you want to stay at home.. Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?. Yes. Matt Damon and Bed Stiller too. A cameo by Brett Favre is also in there.. I don't remember Brett Favre. I think the movie was a bit crude, if I remember. That's not really my thing.. Well then by all means stick with a beautiful day in the neighborhood. You love it. Nothing crude about it.. Do you have any other ideas for being at home? I do like to have options.. You know what you might like. The Truman Show. If you like films about one's neigborhood. Its fascinating.. Oh, I almost watched that one not too long ago. That has Jim Carey?. ", ". Hi there!. Hello! How are you?. I am well, thanks for asking. Today I came to talk about your favorite movies as of recent times. What is your favorite movie that you've seen recently?. I just watched Ford v Ferrari last week and I really enjoyed it. Had good acting and I thought it was an interesting story.. That sounds like an interesting film! What genre would you categorize this movie as? Is i your favorite genre?. Its hard to categorize it, but I would say Action or History. It tells a real story in the movie and the story is entertaining and exciting. There is some action involved. I guess I like true stories about people who did things that were amazing and adventurous.. Oh, I see! So you like true stories, such as of historical figures of people who have accomplished notable things! I am trying to get the best picture of what makes you get on the edge of your seat when you watch.. Yeah they don't have to be war movies, but I do like those a lot as well.. And you mention war movies. Do you like the action aspect of war movies more, or the fact that it is real more? For example, do you also like action movies which are Marvel-based?. I do like Marvel movies as well. I haven't seen all of them but I watch Iron Man, and Captain America and liked those movies quite a bit. I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well.. I see. For you, I recommend Black Mass. This movie is a true biographical film which revolves around an alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob. This is also an action film.. I think I heard of that but I haven't seen it yet. Is that the movie that has Johnny Depp in it or an I thinking of the wrong movie?. That is correct! This movie has Johnny Depp and it is a true film telling of events which took place in the 1970's. You may like this movie if you end up watching it!. I think I really would. Its an interesting era to set the film in as well and I would like seeing the way they portray the 70's in the movie. I think I will watch that movie sounds like a good recommendation..

I hear you need some help in selecting a movie to see.. I would indeed. I was hoping that you may have some ideas on a good movie to see.. What type of film do you usually like?. I have several genre's that I like. I enjoy comedies that aren't silly dumb. I also like everyday neighbor type movies.. Well, along the lines of the last one, there is A beautiful day in the neighborhood. Its about Mr. Rogers.. Hmmm. Who is in that one?. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you.

I watched shot caller. Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. Just with a similar setting. I would like to recommend Hell or High Water. About a couple of brothers who rob a bank to pay off a loan.. That sounds like a instructing movie. Is it a older movie. It is a few years old. 2016. Thats still Farley new. Do you know the main actors in it. Ben Foster and Chris Pine. Never heard of them. How long is the movie duration. About an hour and 40 minutes. Do you know where it was filmed. ", ". Good day, How are you today?. I am wonderful and yourself ?. Great; thanks for asking.. It's a bit cold and rainy where I am at, but just working on staying dry lol. I can relate.

Can I help you find a movie trailer?. Yes, please! I want to see a movie over the holidays and I'm curious about what you might suggest and I'm looking for a recommendation.. Are you wanting a holiday themed movie or are you open to other ideas as well?. I'm open to other ideas. I tend to like action movies and I can't stand horror flicks. Too scary. I like it when movies have a lot of character development.. I don't like horror either! Way too scary. What was the last movie that you watched?. The last movie I watched was Captain Marvel and I really liked it.. Yes! Great movie. Let me see what I can find that I think you will like.. Awesome. Like I said, I like action films and I typically like nerdy films like Star Wars or Marvel stuff. I like witty humor and banter rather than slap-stick type humor. I like a complex, yet understandable plot. Nothing too out there like Inception or anything.. 21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see. With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion.. Hmm, I've never heard of it. What's the gist? I'm assuming about police shooting people? I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda.. It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run.. Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction?. It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies!. Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like my type of movie. I will definitely go see it considering that plot and that actor. Thanks for your recommendation! I'll go see that movie over the holiday.. Great! I hope you really enjoy it and have a happy holiday!. For sure, thanks.. You're welcome!. One last thing, I suppose.

I just watched Knives Out last night and thought it was really good! I like movies that aren't predictable and have a combination of comedy and action.. Darn I haven't seen that one. Hmm, let me think unpredictable action comedy.... I also saw Snowpiercer the day before and liked it a lot - more than Parasite.. Yea, Snowpiercer had some real speed to it. Though both it and Parasite had very pretty cinematography. Do you prefer that prettier more artistic style to a blockbuster action like the new Mission Impossible?. It depends on how I'm feeling in the moment but I usually go for more light hearted films that are easy to digest.. Ahh for a moment I was thinking maybe you'd be interested in another Bong Joon-ho film. The Host is more action packed a 'la Snowpiercer but it does have some white-knuckled horror moments.. I would be interested! What is The Host about?. When toxic waste and American hegemony collide nature(?) produces a monster that puts innocent people at risk. Working together a family must .... That makes me want to learn more about it. I'll definitely look more into it and watch the trailers, etc. I accept your recommendation :).. Great! I hope you enjoy it. Nice chatting..

It looked good and I am interesting in seeing this movie.. Have you seen the trailer for the new James Bond movie? I always see the newest Bond films.. I have not yet, but I am willing to consider seeing the James Bond film.. From what I see, it looks like a logical continuation of the Spectre theme - it has the Bond girl form the last file as well as the newest Blofield.

Diamonds are forever was a classic. I do, however, like the newer films more. Less cynicism and more plausible. What do you think?. I agree. sometimes the remakes are just as good as the orginials..

Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you?. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style?. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["You ever watch Superbad?", "tele me sir", "Great!

I am well, thanks for asking. Today I came to talk about your favorite movies as of recent times. What is your favorite movie that you've seen recently?. I just watched Ford v Ferrari last week and I really enjoyed it. Had good acting and I thought it was an interesting story.. That sounds like an interesting film! What genre would you categorize this movie as? Is i your favorite genre?. Its hard to categorize it, but I would say Action or History. It tells a real story in the movie and the story is entertaining and exciting. There is some action involved. I guess I like true stories about people who did things that were amazing and adventurous.. Oh, I see! So you like true stories, such as of historical figures of people who have accomplished notable things! I am trying to get the best picture of what makes you get on the edge of your seat when you watch.. Yeah they don't have to be war movies, but I do like those a lot as well.. And you mention war movies. Do you like the action aspect of war movies more, or the fact that it is real more? For example, do you also like action movies which are Marvel-based?. I do like Marvel movies as well. I haven't seen all of them but I watch Iron Man, and Captain America and liked those movies quite a bit. I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well.. I see. For you, I recommend Black Mass. This movie is a true biographical film which revolves around an alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob. This is also an action film.. I think I heard of that but I haven't seen it yet. Is that the movie that has Johnny Depp in it or an I thinking of the wrong movie?. That is correct! This movie has Johnny Depp and it is a true film telling of events which took place in the 1970's. You may like this movie if you end up watching it!. I think I really would. Its an interesting era to set the film in as well and I would like seeing the way they portray the 70's in the movie. I think I will watch that movie sounds like a good recommendation.. Do you appreciate these types of films which do take place in older times, aside from modern films?. I do like those a lot, even if I wasn't born in the time period. I just think seeing the old cars, the way people dressed, and less technology in the movies is interesting.. That is very nice. Then I think you will enjoy this movie. It can be characterized as being classic due to the elements you enjoy about older times.. Sounds great, thank you very much for your help.. ", ". Hi how are you doing today!?. I am doing great, how about you?. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Great! What type of movies would you recommend?.

Hello! How are you today?. Hello! I'm great. How are you doing today?. I'm wonderful today. I just finished watching a movie with my kids.. What was the movie about? I've been looking for some movie recommendations.. It was a popular children's movie. What type of movies do you like?. I usually prefer action movies or Science fiction. Anything based on superheroes or similar.. It sounds like you have a diverse genre of movies you like. Nothing boring, lol. Have you seen a lot of recent movies?. The most recent movie I have seen is Bright burn. For recent movies that have been released. I typically enjoy anything action. I don't enjoy romance movies and I'm picky about comedies lol. If you have any recommendations I would greatly appreciate them.. Have you seen Pacific Rim? It's a few years older. It's about aliens and the humans that protect the planet against them. I know you said you like action, superheros, and sci-fi and this movie ticks all three.. No I haven't seen that movie. I know of it but I haven't seen it yet! If it checks all three of those I will definitely look into it. Thank you for your help and recommendation.. You're welcome. I hope you enjoy it.. I hope so too. I've heard it has great reviews. Are there any other movies you might recommend that are action movies?. If you like action, you might enjoy John Wick. If you aren't sensitive to violence, that is.. It depends on the type of violence. I don't like violence such as movies like Saw. I don't like torture.. This is about an ex-hit-man. It might not be your cup of tea. Have you seen the new Avengers movie?. I might look into it but I'm not sure. I actually have seen the new Avengers movie. It was incredible. I do like Marvel and DC comics.. I think I'd stick to my original recommendation. You should check out Pacific Rim.. Alright then I will check pacific rim out. Thank you again for your help!. ", ". Good day, How are you today?. I am wonderful and yourself ?. Great; thanks for asking.. It's a bit cold and rainy where I am at, but just working on staying dry lol. I can relate.

Absolutely is...I would most definitely like to give you some recommendations, but first what type of movies do you like?. I would say that most of what I watch is either a horror movie or action film.. So what was the last good movie you watched?. I went to the movies and saw the Joker. I would say that's what my answer would be.. That movie looks awesome, unfortunately I haven't had the chance to watch it yet!. Its a bit of a slow burn psychological thriller, but I would say its worth I watch. I really enjoyed it. That sounds great. Have you seen the older movie: Natural Born Killers?. I have not, what is it about? Worth watching?. It was released in 1994. Starring Woody Heraldson. It is about a serial killer, with a psychopathic behavior.. Ahh sounds good. I will def have to give that a watch.. ", ". Hello, I'm here to help you get a movie recommendation.. Glad to hear it! What do you have for me?. Well first let me ask what sort of genre are you in the mood for today?. Hmm, let's go for a comedy.. Would you like a recent release or something older?. Preferably something from this year.. Do you mind M rated films or do you want something more kid friendly?. No preference for that either. I'm just as open to an adult comedy as I would be to an animated movie from Pixar or something.. Got it, Then my recommendations are Good Boys, Booksmart and Toy Story 4, do you want to hear more about any of these?. I'm going to go for Toy Story 4. Thank you!. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Yeah definitely. Okay, thank you!. Glad I could help, we need to complete a 2-3 more turns. How much did you like the original movie?. It was one of my favorites as a kidm I wanted to be buzz. Buzz is awesome. Woody and Jess were both awesome too. Honestly, the entire cast was great..

Thanks for the link and the recommendation. I will be watching Captain Marvel tonight. I think the Black Widow movie will be pre-Endgame and from a timeline standpoint occur between the 2 Avengers movies. Thanks again for the idea!. You're Welcome! I'll be intrigued to see it!. Any other movie ideas? I think we like the same genre!. Hmm, I really enjoyed The Martian, which is less alien, but still takes place in space. That's a good one if you haven't seen it!.

Yes I enjoy watching movies especially comediesand animation.. Animation and comedies are great, and nice for get-togethers. I saw Avengers: Endgame recently and really liked it and the CGI. It was dramatic and had a good payoff for their long-running story, esp Ironman. What about you?. I am looking for a good movieto make me smile. Any recommendations?. If you like comedies and animation then the Star Wars movie coming up with baby Yoda would be really nice. He's wonderful and amazing.. I never got into the Star Wars series. Any others?. You might enjoy Addams Family. Its always pretty funny. In another genre, the sequel to the Shining is coming out, its Doctor Sleep and its supposed to be good so I would recommend it.. Isn't the Shining a horror movie? I definitely do not do horror. I am a big baby!. Oh okay. Well you might like to check into Charlies Angels, it looks fun and its a comedy and light-hearted enough for the holidays. Hope you enjoy it!. That may be up my alley. I do like a good chick flick.. In terms of animation, there's a fantasy film that's out called White Snake, thats looking like a solid one... Hmmm I haven't heard of that. Do you know what it is about?Or maybe a holiday movie?. There's a holiday time movie that's animated, something like this?. Is that the name of it? Holiday Time?. First off there's Frozen II.

Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it.. Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception. It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie.. Oh yeah that movie is great.. Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige?. Not yet, but I'm intersted.. I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. It's got so many good actors in it, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and several more big name actors.. Alright I accept your recommendation.. I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie. Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan?. Huh, really? Well, not that one either, what is it about?. It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less. The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think.

It is hard when acting is based only on facial expression and actions, not verbal scripts only. Well in Bird Box instead of not being able to speak they are unable to use their sight.

Hello friend!. Good afternoon! I'm looking for a movie recommendation, something to get my mind off of the current status of our country. I love comedies and since laughter is the best medicine, I'd like to find a family friendly comedy to lift my spirits.. Sure, have you seen Inside Out or CoCo? The creators have made another movie coming out soon.. No, I haven't seen either one. Any actors I would recognize in Inside Out?. Inside Out is an animated movie by Disney, It's definitely family friendly, not really a comedy. That sounds like an excellent recommendation! Thank you! Hope you have a nice weekend, goodbye :). Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind are among the cast. Amy Poehler is a hoot!. I really like the movie, very easy to relate. Definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward.. Is CoCo animated as well?. Yes, it is.. Would you say their are morals/lessons learned targeted towards children in one or both of these?. I would say so. In my opinion, Inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. The key is to have good communication with people you trust. Coco shows the importance of family and tradition.. I personally feel that it is very important that children know that it's okay to 'feel' different ways.

I like heist films a lot, and there was some comedy, but I wanted something newer and more funny. Ah so nothing from like, the 60s or 70s?. No, I'm not really into that. I want something more new-age.. Are you more into hard-hitting action like John Wick as well or more ensemble movies like Ocean's?. I think ensemble movies! I didn't really like John Wick, it was too intense.. I think you'll enjoy Baby Driver, it's a crime movie and features a star studded cast and a great soundtrack.. Oh yeah, I've heard of that one! Thank you, that sounds good. I'm going to accept that recommendation.. Thanks! If you want some more action, check out Man from U.N.C.L.E. as well!. Oh yeah! I've heard of that one, too. Is that with Johnny Depp?. ", ". Hello, I hope you're having a good day today.. Hey! You as well, how's it going? Any good movie recommendations?. Well, are you into history at all?. Definitely! Depending on the type of movie, I more like action and comedy, but if it's like an uplifting history movie I can definitely be into it!. I love comedies also! And if you're into action movies, I highly recommend the John Wick series. It is just jammed packed with stuff happening for the first minute right now do the end.. Okay great! I've heard of those, do you like all of them in the series? There's three, right?. Yes, there are three. I admit, my favorite is the first one, as is the case with most movie series. However, there are so many great actors and the character development is engaging. I think, too, that most Keanu Reeves films have a certain level of comedy that keeps you coming back for more.. Cool! Thanks so much for the recommendation, I'll check those out, the first one will be on the top of my list. Thanks!. Remember, just nonstop action, no chance to lose your attention. I hope you enjoy them!. Thanks so much, I will!. John Wick. Any other good action movies you're excited about that are coming out soon?. Sorry about that, I put it in the wrong box. Ironically, I don't know when it is expected to release, but I heard they are planning to continue the Matrix series (also Keanu!). I heard about that too! Any idea who else is in it?. I heard that all but the actor that plays Agent Smith are planning to return. I loved him, but I am sure they'll figure something out. Enjoy your day!. That would be great! He's an awesome actor, thanks so much, enjoy your day too!. Any other movies you have enjoyed recently?. I really liked Knives Out!. Oh yeah! I was totally thrown by the ending to that! I love Christopher Plumber. I heard they're making a second movie with that one too. The only returning actor is Daniel Craig, as the private investigator.. Oh really? That would be great! I was totally thrown by the twist too. Any other good ones you're excited for? I know a bunch of stuff just moved their release dates.. ", ". Good morning!. Hello!. So what sort of movies are you into? What sort of trailers do you like?. Well, since it is the holiday season I love watching Christmas movies. I know the ones on Netflix are not considered good movies but they are fun and I enjoy laughing at and with them.. Hm, there's a few new ones for this year that look like they might be funny. Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable! There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny!. Oh I don't know if I heard of that one? What is it about? I watched Klaus the other day and it was actually really good like I can see it becoming a Christmas classic.. It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually. Or is supposed to, if he was good at it! So I think it will have a lot of silly moments.. Oh that definetely seems like something I would enjoy! Thanks for the recommendation - I accept it! Sounds kinda similar to what I watched last night, which was about Santa's daughter and how she wanted to go to college and not take over the family business.. That sounds funny too! I hope you enjoy it! Getting into the Christmas spirit!. Yes I am!. I have another suggestion from, an older one that is just as silly as the newer one, called Bad Santa, have you seen that one?.

I like thrillers and comedy mostly, and things with a good cinematography, though i Gotta be in the mood for it. Have you seen the movie Hustlers yet? It is a little bit of a mix of comedy, drama and thriller.. No I haven't, what's it about?. It's about a group of former strippers who work together to turn the tables on their wall street clients. Ahhhh interesting, is it like a laugh-out-loud comedy, or like a quiet chuckle?. ", ". Hi! I'm here to help you find a trailer!. Sounds great, what do you recommend?. Hmm depends. What kinda genre are you looking for?. I prefer a suspense movie. Oh those are good ones! What was the last one you watched?. I just watched Shutter Island, big fan. That was a good movie! You must like the edge of your-seat-kind of suspense. I'd totally recommend the movie Split!. What is that about?. It's a man that has around 25 different personalities that are trying to make the world pure. Watching the actor shift between characters really plays with your mind.. Wow, that sounds interesting. Who's the main actor? Must have been hard to play 25 different people. He's James McAvoy, he's also the younger Professor X from the X-Men movies. He dd an amazing job jumping between characters. He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film.. I loved the X-Men movies. Do you have any recommendation on superhero movies as well?. Hands down would be Deadpool and Deadpool 2 especially if you love the X-Men!. I saw the first one, is Deadpool 2 about a similar plot?. Only a little. It pushes more as a continuation from the first one. Deadpool actually gets a team together and learns the meaning of family.. What do you think about the new Joker?. To be honest, I haven't seen it yet but it's on my top list! I know it doesn't follow the DC line but it puts a human face to Joker which is something that has never been done. I love that kind of in depth cinema. I can't wait to see it.. I just recently saw it and definitely think it's bound to get an Oscar nomination! What did you think off Avengers Endgame?. That movie was insane! Utterly graphically insane! I loved it!! The did such a well rounded end it was such a surprise.. Agreed! Well thank you for your recommendations! I accept your recommendations to watch Deadpool 2 and Split. ", ". Hello!. Hey. What are some of your favorite movies?. The Notebook, Togo, movies like that. Those are two very different movies! What do you like about The Notebook?. I like the way it reflects real life people, even though the ending is a bit hard to believe.. And what do you like about Togo?. I lived in Alaska for years and I could relate to the characters in that movie. I have always wanted to see Alaska! What is the most recent movie you watched?. Bad with Titles....oh yeah, Fast and Furious 2. Did you enjoy The Fast and Furious 2?. It wasn't my favorite. I was expecting to see more cars but all I got was a silly plot.. What are some of your least favorite movies?. Fast and Furious 2 for sure. Date with the Devil, Final Destination. What did you dislike about Final Destination?. Just wasn't my cup of tea.

A classic would be The Firm that stars Tom Cruise, based on the novel of the same name. It focuses more on a scandal of a law firm, but still has some great drama and thrilling elements.

Hey there, I'm Mike and I'm here to help you you find a movie trailer. Cool, thanks Mike. FYI i don't like gory movies. Well, that takes one genre out of the way. :D Are you looking for something on the other side of the slide? Maybe a romcom or comedy?. I forgot to mention I also don't like romcom's but I do like to laugh.. Yeah, romcoms aren't high on my list either, but since I watch *a lot of movies, I dip my toe in every once in a while. Since laughter is the best medicine, what kind of comedy do you prefer? Maybe letting me know what you watched last will give me an idea. The last comedy I watched was Blockers. But I do like a good zombie movie as well.. Kinda hard not to like anything that Seth Rogen touches, that guy has a direct line to my funny bone. So, a fellow zombie fan as well...how about a combination of the two??. Seth Rogen is pretty funny LoL. I would love a combo movie! What you got?. I'm going to reach back to one of my go to recommendations to see if you've seen it...Fido. I have not but I'm intrigued...is it similar to shaun of the dead?. Same vein (and I've watched Shaun of the Dead more times that I'm willing to admit). Think Pleasantville style meets Shaun of the Dead.. Nice! I like it already! As i mentioned I'm not a big gory fan but if it makes me laugh I will let it slide. I will accept your recommendation. I can't wait to watch it. OK, thanks for recommendation.. It's my pleasure, is there anything else I can recommend for you?. Nope, I think this is plenty. Thanks again.. Awesome, have a great evening and enjoy the movie!. : ). ", ". Hello. Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me?. Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc.... I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama.. Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.. It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining.. I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it.. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL. I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!. No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split.. I just watched Split recently! I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.. ", ". hi, how are you doing today. well,yourself?.

It's about how Neil Armstrong joins the space program, spending years in training and risking his life during test flights. And finally their journey to moon. It's a very personal movie, gives you insight into his life.. Is it entertaining or slow paced?. Very entertaining, pretty much the whole 10 years of moon landing preparation packed in 2 hours of movie. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Doesn't seem like my style honestly.

What types of movies do you usually watch? & what movie is your all time favorite?. I like drama, action and comedy movies the most. My favorite movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey. What is your favorite movie?. my favorite is dirty dancing. I am looking for recommendations on movies I can buy for my husband for as a christmas gift. what would you recommend?. For recent movies, I really like Sully, the true story about when a pilot landed a plane on The Hudson River in New York in 2009, in freezing conditions. The 2 minute trailer for it on YouTube is also very exciting.. I have not seen that one. I will have to check it out. thank you. have you seen the movie what dreams may come? my son and I were actually talking about it yesterday. its a movie from 1998 but the graphics are very vibrant and rich. The concept of the movie is very unique which is something that I enjoy. I get tired of watching movies that have the same concepts but with different actors.. I've heard of that movie, with Robin Williams. I have it on my list of movies I want to see. Your husband will enjoy Sully. It's a movie you can watch parts of over and over, because of the tension and drama of landing the plane.. I will check out the trailer for the movie. Do you have any other recommendations? I worry about the movie being about landing a plane only because my husband was in the military and has some ptsd so I have to be careful with what we watch. He doesn't do well with military, helicopters, war or planes.. Maybe a non-action drama would be better. I highly recommend Spotlight about The Boston Globe and their investigative efforts. No action, just people working hard.. Thank you I am sure that we both would enjoy that movie. Thank you for your help I feel good about that movie it sounds very interesting and something the whole family can enjoy.. I have selected Spotlight on the left. It shows some details about it.. I will definitely check it out. thank you for your help. is there any other movie you would suggest. ", ". Hello, I'm here to help you pick out a movie trailer.. Great, I'd like a crime thriller..

Let's try to find something else, then. How about a true crime story?. That sounds good.. Okay. Let's first watch the Inception trailer, and then we will find a true crime trailer for you.. Okay, that sounds goo.. Here's an intriguing true crime story. It's called Dark, about a murder investigation of a slain businessman. Lots of twists and turns.. That sounds very interesting.. I find that mysteries are most engaging when the story behind them is true. Do you agree?. Yeah, I think that can be true. But most of the time it seems like the creators have to embellish or change things at least a little bit to suit the screen.. True; sometimes we don't really know exactly what happened, so the director has to fill in the blanks.. So this movie dark is on Netflix?:).

Have you seen Erin Brockvich with Julia Roberts?. Yes, that's a good one. I'm looking for something a little more current.. Have you considered the live action movie Mulan?. That sounds like a great idea. Is it good for young kids?. Yes it's a Disney film adaption of their animated movie.. Wonderful. I'd love to see it. Thank you so much for your recommendation!. One moment while I get the trailer up for you.. I can't wait to see it.. Alright it should be right up now.. This looks like a great movie to take my family to see with me. Do you have any suggestions for something I could watch with my husband on a date?. Hmm give me one moment to find something romantic for you both!:). Nothing too sappy though!. Hmm maybe a romcom?. That sounds good. My husband gets bored and falls asleep if the movie isn't funny or exciting.. ", ". Hi.. I understand you are looking for a movie trailer to watch!. Yes. Great. I'd love to help you. What kind of movies do you generally like?. I love action, comedy and romance movies. Thats a pretty broad range. Great!

Watched a lot of great movies this weekend. Which ones are some of your favorites?. I am into funny movies... do you have any suggestions of trailers to check out so I can go to the movies next week?. I am into funny movies also, which is why I am suggesting maybe seeing a different genre. I have been to the movies recently and the comedy movie selection is poor. I would not want to see you waste your money. What about action movies?. ok I would go see an action film. I am also really into war movies that depict American History. How much do you know about Pearl Harbor?. thanks for the help... that could b e a good option... any other recommendations?. I would recommend seeing Midway if you are into action/war movies. The movie does a great job at illustrating the attack on our country and Pearl Harbor. The actors in the movie are amazing as well. Perfect movie for a night out.. ok I think that sounds great... what is your favorite movie ever?. My favorite movie ever is Saving Private Ryan. Midway is very much like this movie.. ok great I love that movies as well. I accept your recommendation to see Midway.. Awesome. What is your favorite movie of all time?. for sound engineering I loved Fury... though a bit too violent... I also loved Inglorious Basterds but that was not really historically accurate ;-). Inglorious Basterds is a great movie as well. Have you ever seen American Sniper?. yes it was pretty awesome Bradley Cooper was great. Bradley Cooper did a great job playing the role of Chris Kyle. It is amazing to me how many tours in Iraq Chris did and the danger he faced, only to be killed by one of his own men domestically.. yes that was sad... anyways thanks for the chat I am looking forward to seeing midway!.

Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind?. Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from.. I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up.. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary.. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?. This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright.. I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different?. It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was Ready or Not which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best!. Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend?. I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy.. Thank you so much!. My pleasure to help you with your choices.. I look forward to seeing it!. ", ". Hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. i am looking for a scary movie.. ", ". Hi there! How are you today?. Hello! I am doing well, and yourself?.

I think I might have the perfect one for you. What's the most recent superhero movie you've watched?. I believe the most recent movie I watched was Captain Marvel.. Nice! One of my best friends loves Marvel movies. Who's your favorite character on there?. Captain Marvel of course! I loved Gaurdians of the Galaxy much more though, I love Gamora!. Gamora is definitely a unique character in my opinion! When I learned she was the adopted daughter of Thanos, I instantly knew she would get all the hype! What about in terms of comedy? What is your favorite comedy?. I agree! My favorite comedy is Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. You can't beat Jim Carrey. You really can't! He's an icon for sure. I think I might have a great movie for you!. Okay great! What do you recommend?. Deadpool. It's a comedy with a superhero vibe to it. VERY funny and the action is tremendous!.

Hi I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer or movie recommendation. Great. A really good movie is called Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.. Yes, that sounds good. What is it about?. A prison buddy movie where a new guy finds a friend. And the harsh realities of prison life. But an uplifting story as well.. Wow, tell me more. It's set in the past, not in today's modern world. And the prison was a tough system. Corrupt cops and all.. Morgan Freeman is an excellent actor. ", ". Hello!. Hi there!. Do you know what kind of movies do you like?. I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers. I also love horror! I am not a fan of action films or romance much.. What was the last horror movie you watched?. I saw Midsommar in theaters. I didn't think it was scary, more just upsetting, I really liked Hereditary which is from the same director. I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake!. I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic! I think the casting was perfect. oh my gosh YES! I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect. Did you see Get Out or Us? What did you think? I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes. I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me.. Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world.. and her voice?! Holy crap. That and her physical movements. I thought that was such a standout performance. Apparently she didn't tell anyone she was doing the voice like that until they started rolling and the other actors were absolutely terrified.. She is amazing! based on your taste in films, i would recommend A Quiet Place,. Wonderful. I absolutely adored A Quiet Place. The fact that they used a deaf actress and sign language was fantastic. I am heavily involved in the deaf community and know ASL myself, so I was so beyond pleased with the film and authentic representation of the deaf community. I accept!. Amazing, thank you!. Did you see Birdbox? I thought it was pretty well done as well even though it was a similar concept.. I have but i was truly disappointed in the ending. totally. I liked that they used blind people but it was a bit of a cop out ending. I also wanted to know why the crazy people from the mental hospital weren't affected?. It seems like they ran out of ideas and wanted to fill time, a common thread for Netflix films. haha absolutely. I watched tall girl because I knew it would be bad and boy was it. So so cheesy.. ", ". hello, My name is Matt and i am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi Matt, nice to meet you!. nice to meet you aswell. What kinda movies are you in to. I particularly like Animated Flicks like Frozzen or Mohana.. I enjoy those types of movies sometimes. But I'm really into SciFi and Horror movies.. ScyFi, cool. Have you seen the new Terminator Movie? they brohgt back Linda Hammiltton to repreice her role as Sarah Connor. Yes I did see it and loved it. I really like that they brought back Arnold and Linda for that movie. Underworld is my current favorite. Love movies about vampires and werewolves too.. How about Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman about the notorious monster hunter trying to stop Dracula,. Oh that sounds interesting. When was it released?. It came out on 2004. i like it a lot. the effects still hold up to this day and the story is actually really good, it has good twists and adventure. sounds like something I would like, thank you for the suggestion. Any other movies like that, that I might like?. I am Legend with Will smith, i like the version of vampires in this movie, vampires created by science in look for a cure for cancer. oh wow that sounds like a good storyline. Is that the one where he is all alone?. yes he is alone in Manhatthan, i like the relatioship between him Will Smith and his dog. Am a dog person. okay I will see about watching that one for sure. I do like will smith's movies so should be good. I always like him in I, Robot. I, Robot is an amazing film, if you liked him on that you will defenetly enjoy I am Legend. he has to carry most of the film on his own and the twist at the end is also good. i can only imaigine how hard it would be to carry that whole movie alive..

I am looking for some movie recommendations. Maybe something from a female filmmaker. I like all genres.. The Invisible Man is a good one not only is it female directed but the female is a young lady building an empire. This Invisible Man is unlike any past versions.. You mean the new one with Elizabeth Moss?. Yes Indeed. Okay that sounds good to me. I accept. Thanks!. Great Enjoy. Is there anyone else of note in it?. Yes and if thats not your speed Wonder Woman is also a good one. Is WW on Netflix yet? I know it came out a while ago.. ", ". Hi, how are you doing today?. hey there. doing ok. how are you?. I'm doing pretty good. Would you like a movie recommendation?. I totally would.. ", ". Hello, I understand you like movies!. Yes, what is a comedy movie you would recommend?. Do you like romantic comedies, slapstick, or comedies with a good story?. Romantic or with a good story! I like witty humor.. Do you like old classic films that may be in black and white or do you prefer newer works?. I prefer newer works.. OK one of the really good new ones is called Longshot. Have you heard of it?. No, what is it about?. It is a classic formula of two people from different worlds finding each other. What is interesting is the actors. Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. Not two people you would tend to see in a movie together. I guess that's why it's called Longshot. I'm not sure I am interested.. One from earlier this year was Always Be My Maybe. About two people whose paths crossed over the years but they never got together as the timing was always wrong and their destinies took them different places. That one sounds more interesting.. Cool, one of my favorites this year was Murder Mystery with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler. The formula is the stale couple rekindling their romance but it takes place on a yacht and a murder takes place and they find themselves in the middle of trying to solve it while working out their relationship issues.. I can't stand Adam Sandler movies... which is unfortunate because I love Jennifer Aniston.. Well this one is a bit different but depends on whether you like Rebel Wilson or not. She stars as a person who hates Rom Coms, gets knocked and finds herself living the plot of a Rom Com. Learning life lessons and finding love along the way.. I think she is a bit overrated. I need a witty movie!. OK I am going to reach back here. John Cusack stars as a professional hit man who walked out on his girlfriend just before senior prom and returns 10 years later for the reunion and to try and get back together with his girlfriend Minnie Driver. He is also trying to reconcile his job with trying to have a normal life. Grosse Point Blanke. That sounds more interesting. OK, another good one from a few years ago is Chasing Amy, a Kevin Smith film starring Ben Affleck about a comic book artist who falls in love with a woman who is currently living a lesbian lifestyle. Both discover a lot about themselves and has a lot of Kevin Smith type humor in it.. I think I will go with Grosse Point Blanke..

Hi! what kind of movies do you like?. I'm looking for a really good movie with action, a good plot and excitement/suspense. Do you have any good recomendation for me?. I really enjoyed The Quiet Place. It's about aliens that attack if they hear you. Most of the movie doesn't have a soundtrack, so every noise is suspenseful.. Interesting. I have never heard of that movie before, but I'm not really into aliens. Could you recommend a movie to me with humans in it? Maybe something along the lines of government plots?. Have you seen the Jason Bourne movies? A man with amnesia is being chased by government agents. He has to figure out who he is and what they want.. Yes! I LOVE that movie! That is a great recommendation. But I've already watched the entire series. Do you have any other government movies that you could recommend for me?. Argo has lots of suspense. Six people from the US Embassy in Iran have to go into hiding after Islamists attack.. Now that sounds very interesting. I'm going to take that recommendation. Thank you so much for taking the time to offer me such a great suggestion. I very much appreciate it. Please have a great day!. Have a good one!. Oh. I'm sorry. That last recommendation was so good, I don't know what to do when I'm finished watching that one LoL! Can you offer me a few more suggestions?. The Mission Impossible Movies are good if you want something a little more light-hearted.. That's another great series also. I watched the entire thing. Do you have some more?. If you don't mind super hero flick, Captain America Winter Soldier has political intrigue.. I love the dynamic of politics in super hero genres. Good choice. How about something romantic with drama.. I haven't seen this one but my sister loved Silver Linings Playbook with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper.. I haven't seen that one either, but heard about it. I'm going to accept that recommendation. Thank you for that. Do you have any recommendations about fast supercars?. Fast and Furious movies! These have action and drama as well. Some funny parts too.. I thought that you might recommend that :-) Great choice. I've seen them all. How about a good documentary about the industrial revolution?. ", ". Hello! how are you?. I am well, how are you?. Good! what kind of movie do you enjoy watching. I like movies - generally, most movies work for me! I am seeking a recommendation on movies that are well made with great female characters.. You should check out the movie Bad Moms. Really? What do you like about this movie?. Its hilarious. it features Mila Kunis, kristen Bell,Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate... Those are A-quality movie stars. Thank you! Would you also have a recommendation on drama? I just saw Little Women in the theatres, it was better than I thought.. I personally love Marley and me featuring Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson. That one is about a dog? That is great.

I forgot to mention I also don't like romcom's but I do like to laugh.. Yeah, romcoms aren't high on my list either, but since I watch *a lot of movies, I dip my toe in every once in a while. Since laughter is the best medicine, what kind of comedy do you prefer? Maybe letting me know what you watched last will give me an idea. The last comedy I watched was Blockers. But I do like a good zombie movie as well.. Kinda hard not to like anything that Seth Rogen touches, that guy has a direct line to my funny bone. So, a fellow zombie fan as well...how about a combination of the two??. Seth Rogen is pretty funny LoL. I would love a combo movie! What you got?. I'm going to reach back to one of my go to recommendations to see if you've seen it...Fido. I have not but I'm intrigued...is it similar to shaun of the dead?.

I prefer serious over trash humor, if that makes sense. I don't like movies with crass humor. I like good stories. Yeah, I agree. I really enjoy the Star Wars films, and I'm always on the lookout to find similar movies. I enjoy the action-adventure type movies with a healthy mix of a good story with appropriate humor..

I have!I watched all of them in chronological order last year - was a really fun way to watch them. I don't know that I ever saw a trailer for any of the earlier ones, though. I didn't start watching them until Guardians of the Galaxy 2. One of my favorites is the first Guardians of the Galaxy. I think it's really funny, and it had a very different mood than the previous Marvel films. Plus I really like Chris Pratt as an actor!. I agree!

What types of movies do you like?. i really like action/adventure movies, and i enjoy a good horror film too. do you have any suggestions?. I did just watch a horror movie called Midsommar with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd. You heard of it?. i have, and i've seen it too! i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time. i appreciate the cinematography though. since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations?. Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha. Anyways, other ones I liked recently were Joker (though most people have seen that haha), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Oldie but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be Blood (super weird and quite good). ohh, you know what, i haven't seen Joker yet but i've really been wanting to! i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently? No Country for Old Men is one i've been meaning to watch as well, thank you for the reminder, haha!. Oh nice! Yeah, I was late to the Joker train but it's fascinating movie. I know that a lot of hype can bring people into movies with inflated expectations but I went in knowing as little as possible and it really was great. Awesome atmosphere and great acting.. i try not to let the hype affect my expectations too much, but sometimes i can't help but hold a movie to a higher standard after a certain point. well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance!. Nice :). Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects. oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie.. Well they both have unusually great acting so that'll definitely be a plus for you. Joker's massively pushed forward by Phoenix's great acting.. fantastic, that's really reassuring to hear! the last film i saw with Phoenix in it was Signs, and he was awesome in that as well.. I'm not sure I've actually seen anything else he was in that I recognized at least haha. But I was thinking of looking up some other ones to see after this movie, though I got distracted and never followed through with that. Maybe now I'll remember :P. oh, really? Signs is a great place to start.:). ", ". Hi!. Hey. What kind of movies do you like?. I love Horror Movies. Also I like Action, Thrillers and Drama.. What's the last horror movie you saw?. The last one I saw was Insidious: Last Key.. Anything stand out for you, in terms of what you liked or disliked about it?. I liked the fact that the woman is a psychic/medium who went back to her childhood home to get rid of the evil that she released. She found out the secret of many bodies hidden in the house and her dad was a part of it. I disliked how it didn't scare me or make me jump like I would like horror movies to do.. It still sounds like something I'd enjoy. I like horror a lot too. The scariest movies I've ever seen were Event Horizon, Silent Hill and the original Nightmare on Elm Street. Have you seen any of those?. I have seen Silent Hill and Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't remember if I have seen Event Horizon. The name of the movie is familiar, but if I have seen it it has been a long time. I do love the serial killer type movies too. My favorite is Michael Myers. He's my favorite.. I've never seen any of those. But I highly recommend Event Horizon if you haven't seen it. It's about a warp drive engine that opens up a gateway to hell, and has some horrific scenes of demonic entities.. Oh heck yes. Now I am more interested. Well thank you for that recommendation, I will definitely look into it. ", ". Hello, how may i help you today?. hi i am looking for a good movie to go see today. Ah my specialty! What is your favorite genre?. i love mysteries and thrillers. So i can see what type of thriller you like what was the last thriller you've see?. i saw get out and i liked it. i also like to watch scary movies. Ah a Jordan Peele masterpiece! Judging by that I would recommend another of Jordan Peele's work. how about a movie with Daniel Craig?. Have you seen Dream house? It stars Daniel Craig.. i have not seen that one. i also like Julia Roberts. I recommend watching wonder it's an amazing movie about a boy with facial differences and his struggle during fifth grade.. thank you i will go see Wonder this afternoon. Awesome! Glad i could help.

I would not want to see you waste your money. What about action movies?. ok I would go see an action film. I am also really into war movies that depict American History. How much do you know about Pearl Harbor?. thanks for the help... that could b e a good option... any other recommendations?. I would recommend seeing Midway if you are into action/war movies. The movie does a great job at illustrating the attack on our country and Pearl Harbor. The actors in the movie are amazing as well. Perfect movie for a night out.. ok I think that sounds great... what is your favorite movie ever?. My favorite movie ever is Saving Private Ryan. Midway is very much like this movie.. ok great I love that movies as well. I accept your recommendation to see Midway.. Awesome. What is your favorite movie of all time?. for sound engineering I loved Fury... though a bit too violent... I also loved Inglorious Basterds but that was not really historically accurate ;-). Inglorious Basterds is a great movie as well. Have you ever seen American Sniper?. yes it was pretty awesome Bradley Cooper was great. Bradley Cooper did a great job playing the role of Chris Kyle. It is amazing to me how many tours in Iraq Chris did and the danger he faced, only to be killed by one of his own men domestically.. yes that was sad... anyways thanks for the chat I am looking forward to seeing midway!.

What type of movies do you like KM. I'm into all kinds of movies. Usually action, but I like comedy movies and serious dramas too.. Ah I like romantic comedy the best.. Romantic Comedy is a good genre. The wife and I watch those together often.. is there a particular actor you like?. Not necessarily. I'm open to any actors as long as they are decent. DeCaprio, Hanks, Smith..Pitt, any of them are always pretty watchable.. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi I am looking for a movie trailer. I like anything that's a comedy.. What is the last movie you watched?. Burlesque (2010). Okay! Are you looking for a movie trailer similar to this (drama/romance) or still just comedy?. Just a comedy. I was really impressed with Where'd You Go Bernadette. I thought it was the perfect combination of funny and interesting.. Okay thank you for your help I will check it out!. Great! I watched it with some of my friends and we really enjoyed it. Kind of quirky as well. I hope you are able to enjoy it as well.. Thanks so much!. So would you like to watch the movie trailer?. Yes I would. I think you will really enjoy it! It has Cate Blanchett in it.. Thanks I will watch it!. Do you like mysteries?. Yeah I do. That is another reason why I enjoyed this movie. It's funny and has a little bit of mystery involved with it too. It's the perfect balance I think.. Yeah I watched the trailer and it looks really good im gonna watch it now. Thank you so much.. Of course! I am so glad that you are as intrigued as I was when I watched the trailer. I really hope you are able to enjoy the movie as well.. Yeah thank you so much, I had never heard of this movie before so i'm glad it was recommended to me.. I never had either, but once I watched the trailer I knew I had to watch it. Sometimes I have such a hard time finding a good quality movie. It's the ones you do not hear about that surprise you sometimes!. Yeah I know thanks again!. No problem! I was surprised that I had never heard of it and especially becasue Cate Blanchett is in big movies such as Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Ocean's 8, etc. She really is a great actress I think. Do you like movies like Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones?. Yeah i do I haven't watched all of the movies in each series but ive seen some from each and I really like them.. That's how I am too! Especially with Harry Potter and Star Wars movies. They are not really part of my favorite genre, but I have watched a few from each series. Have you watched Harry Potter or Star Wars?. Yeah Ive seen all of the Harry Potter movies but i've seen only some of the Star Wars movies. I really like both franchises though.. I am the opposite. I have seen only some of Harry Potter and almost all of Star Wars. I think they both are a nice change. Yeah I really like both. It's interesting to see how Star Wars paved the way for a story like Harry Potter, their plots both follow the cycle of the hero's journey.. ", ". How are you today?. hi, how are you? I love to hear about movies.. Have you seen any trailers for movies coming out soon? If so, which ones are you interested in seeing?. I have seen a trailer for the new movie that came out on February 14th. It was Sonic the Hedgehog.. Was the movie any good? The trailer made it look amusing.. It looked good and I am interesting in seeing this movie.. Have you seen the trailer for the new James Bond movie? I always see the newest Bond films.. I have not yet, but I am willing to consider seeing the James Bond film.. From what I see, it looks like a logical continuation of the Spectre theme - it has the Bond girl form the last file as well as the newest Blofield. I think this will be great.. hmmm that sounds good. that reminds me of the older james bond movie with sean connery- diamonds are forever. if you got the trailer, i would be willing to watch it.. Diamonds are forever was a classic. I do, however, like the newer films more. Less cynicism and more plausible. What do you think?. I agree. sometimes the remakes are just as good as the orginials.. I am looking at the trailer for Casino Royale - a great reboot is ever there was one.. great movie. i liked daniel craig playing poker in that movie..

Its already out. it hit theaters on November 8, but it should be still playing. oh ok, ill have to see what movie theaters near me are still playing it. keeping my fingers crossed.. what was the last movie you've seen?. in theaters?. yes, sorry, I should have been more specific. last movie i saw in theaters was Toy Story 4. Did you enjoy it? I think everything after the first one went down hill. nah, all the Toy Story movies were great. they each had something in it for everyone. Well, to be fair, i wasnt even a huge fan of the first one, so I'm not the best judge. Anyway, back to Doctor Sleep, are you a fan of the cast (Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Furguson) or are you just interested in the story?. i like the cast and the story seems interesting so ill probably go see it. Cool, i haven't seen it yet either, but i intend to. There's just too many things coming out recently for me to keep up. same, so many options so little tie. Honestly, I'm running out of things to say lol, but they won't let me leave yet. So...I'm especially looking forward to Ewan McGregor's performance, i really like him as an actor and I think he'll excel in this role. same here, you know any other good movies out right now?. Ford Vs Ferrari was really good in my opinion and I'm lookinf forward to Knives Out, but I haven't seen it yet. You?. what is knives out about.

R rated comedies are one of my favorite types of movies too. I think I have a sense of what you'd enjoy watching. Ok that is good I also like seth mcfarland. I think we have similar tastes in comedians. What movies have you seen recently that stood out to you?. Its not a new movie but I saw Ted and really liked it. Ted was pretty funny. I haven't watched it in a while, but I remember liking it when it came out. Interesting concept for a movie. Do you like the movie superbad?. I have never heard of it! I might. I think you would. Seth Rogan has a small part in it, but it's really funny overall. Great cast of talented comedians. Lots of laugh out loud moments.. What is the plot?. Two co-dependent high school seniors are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry.. That does sound cool! What is it rated?. I believe it is rated R, if that's what you were asking. Apparently Rotten tomatoes gave it an 87% so a good amount of people enjoyed the movie.. That does sound good! Would you happen to know if it includes nudity?.

Are there any genres that you don't like?. Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad.

I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking! What is the last movie you watched if you don't mind my asking?. I last saw Little Women. It was good. I liked most of the actors. Maybe now I'm looking for something with a little more adventure. Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho.. Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation?. I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals. Like A Dog's Purpose. Very well done,but that was a while ago. Just thought there might be something similar out.. I understand! Have you read anything about the new Dolittle movie? It just recently came out in January so is relatively new. If not, what is it about that movie that disinterests you?. Oh yea! I haven't really read anything recently, but isn't that the one with Robert Downey Jr.?nWhat is it rated?. It is! It is rated PG, so a little more geared towards children however it combines action & adventure with comedy- a feel good movie you might say!. Hey! I think that is a great idea! As long as it's not rated G, it works for me. Not a fan of sitting in a theater with a bunch of little kids. I do like me some Robert Downey Jr! :) I will take your recommendation! Thank You!. Great! I sure hope you enjoy it! He is a great actor. I do feel that this one is the best adaptation of all of the Dolittle movies. Have you seen any of the older ones?. Yes, I saw the one with the guy from My Fair Lady, but that was a long time ago. Thanks again.. Yeah the other ones are pretty old and not my favorite to be honest. Did you ever seen the original one? It won a bunch of awards back in the day!. Not sure if it was the original or not, but it was the musical one. I actually liked it very mucn but I like musicals. They don't have many of those anymore. Mama Mia was good! Like most movies they should quit while they are ahead because the second one wasn't so good. Same thing happened with Grease.. ", ". Hello!.

Ah there's nothing wrong with enjoying a good kid movies! What types of age appropriate movies do you like?. I really like comedies. Anything with Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd or any other comedian that's really ironic. I really enjoy movies where there is a huge misunderstanding that kind of spirals out of control. Kind of like Pineapple Express or Burn After Reading. Have you seen Burn After Reading?. Yes I have, and I enjoyed it. Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd are also some of my favorite comedians, along with Jason Bateman. Have you seen any of his movies?. Yes, I really like Horrible Bosses!. A great movie!

What types of movies do you like?. i really like action/adventure movies, and i enjoy a good horror film too. do you have any suggestions?. I did just watch a horror movie called Midsommar with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd. You heard of it?. i have, and i've seen it too! i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time. i appreciate the cinematography though. since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations?. Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha. Anyways, other ones I liked recently were Joker (though most people have seen that haha), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Oldie but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be Blood (super weird and quite good). ohh, you know what, i haven't seen Joker yet but i've really been wanting to! i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently? No Country for Old Men is one i've been meaning to watch as well, thank you for the reminder, haha!. Oh nice! Yeah, I was late to the Joker train but it's fascinating movie. I know that a lot of hype can bring people into movies with inflated expectations but I went in knowing as little as possible and it really was great. Awesome atmosphere and great acting.. i try not to let the hype affect my expectations too much, but sometimes i can't help but hold a movie to a higher standard after a certain point. well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance!. Nice :). Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects. oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie.. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer is there any movies you'd like to see the trailers of ?. I want to see a movie that is full of twists and turns and more about the plot than relationships or sex. hmm what about Carrie (1976) the twist ending in this movie is both impossible and too terrifying to forget.. Carrie is good, but I want something with more of a twist like the village or the uninvited I want something that is scary, but not all blood and gore, but more mind blowing, like... wow didn't think that would happen.. can i recommend maybe geralds game its not a blood & gore movie more of like a psycological horror thriller suspense. its about a woman who accidentally kills her husband during a kinky game and shes left hand cuffed to the bed and starts seeing strange things figures etc its pretty good movie and i think itll fit what youre looking for. that sounds good, I accept that suggestion. alright id like to talk to you more about the movies you like and recommend more before im able to give you that suggestion what do you like about the movie the uninvited i actually loved that movie as well. the ending was amazing, and every time i watch it with someone new i see new things that point to it. I also like Spanish films that have twists like the orphanage and pan's laborith. it was i loved that movie oh ive never seen those ill have to take a look at them what did you like about the spanish films and is there any other genres of really love. psychological thrillers for late nights or mindless days and action movies where it isn't all about naked people but have death and murder and sometimes ridiculous things happen makes it entertaining like john wick. john wick is a fantastic movie what did you like about that one and ill now send you the trailer for geralds game if you still accept that suggestion its a great film and i think you'd love it !. yes i accept.

Hello, I'm here to help recommend you a movie! How are you?. I'm great! How are you? I'm a huge fan of horror films - particularly those that deal more with dread than gore.. Oh man, I love horror movies! What have you seen recently that you liked?. The last horror film I saw and liked was A Quiet Place. Such a unique film that relied on silence!. I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different?. A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!. I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.. Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dread in horror. Can you explain to me what The Transfiguration is about?. The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster. You get to follow him through a snapshot of his story, and all of it is very dark.. That actually sounds like an intriguing and unique premise. Plus a fresh take on the vampire genre. Is it a newer film (like within the last 15 years)? Or older?. It came out in 2016 in the Cannes Film Festival from an Australian director. Haha, I had a Shudder account for a brief time and found it there while I was movie binging.. Was it well received at Cannes? I know just being accepted there tells me it should be a great movie!. It was well received and nominated for a few prizes but won nothing at Cannes. It did however win the General Jury prize at Dublin International in 2017.. Honestly though, just being nominated is an accomplishment in itself. Do you know the Rotten Tomatoes score?. It's got 85% on Rotten Tomatoes! Only a 6/10 on IMDB but I think they were being a little hard on it for being an Indie film. It's almost slow moving in its thoughtfulness, but really pulled me in with its unique take on the theory of vampirism.. 85 is a great score considering how harsh Rotten Tomatoes can be. But the fact that you said it's slow moving in its thoughtfulness really piques my interest as I can't stand fast paced horror films plagued with jump scares. Does anyone famous star in it?. No, it's a film full of fresh meat! I actually sort of prefer horror movies this way, because you can go into it almost blind and you can really evaluate the talent or passion of the actors involved. I also love lesser known directors as I feel like they're willing to take shots other more well known directors might not take or just plain overdo. Do you look for more famous actors when you look for horror films?. So true! And honestly, I don't as I feel having someone you don't know makes it easier to relate where as with someone famous, it's a distraction because you already kmow them. I think I may just accept your recommendation and check it out! Is there anything else I should know about it beforehand?. ", ". Hello!. Hello - how are you?. Can't complain! I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. What kind of movies do you like?. I like documentaries and dramas, sometimes comedies.. Cool! I would recommend American Factory first, it won this year for the 2020 Best Documentary Academy Award!. Oooh, that sounds cool! I will put that on my watch list. I am looking for a recommendation for a drama. Do you have one?. I recently watched Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler, directed by the Safdie brothers. It's a fast-paced drama about a jewelry dealer in New York. Adam Sandler is outstanding in it!. That sounds just like what I am looking for. I accept your recommendation!. ", ".

Are you into Science Fiction or more into action?. I'm open for anything. I'm not picky whatsoever.. Is there any movie that you've disliked? Any pet peeves?. I mean, there's been mediocre films, but for the most part, I can find a reason to enjoy a movie, even if for the effort or unique premise. I honestly cannot recall the last film I left theaters being upset seeing.. You're very open minded! Would you say you appreciate the production value over the acting/script?. They both play important roles to me. A boring concept with great acting can make a decent film as much as a very unique plot with mediocre acting. Like Godzilla is giant monsters fighting, acting doesn't really matter there, or something like Hateful Eight is a half dozen people sitting in a room and talking for 3 hours, yet it was thrilling.. I would recommend checking out Raising Arizona if you haven't before! Its a very creative and heart-felt comedy about an ex convict and his wife raising a baby. The plot sounds simple but the script is really good, as is the acting. If you're a fan of Nicholas Cage, this is one of his best performances.. Oh I've heard of that. Coen Brothers have made several outstanding films. I may have seen this when I was younger, but I legit don't remember. I'll check and see if it's on any streaming.. ", ". Hello!. Hey whats up!. Not much! So, what types of films do you like. im more into action movies and those that can get me hooked into the story. Alright, and what types of movies do you NOT enjoy?. movies that have very simple plots. Got it! I would recommend a movie called Kill Bill, vol. 1, if you enjoy action films!. ive heard of it! ill have to watch the trailer, is there more than 1 kill bill?. ", ". Hello!. Hi!. I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. Do you know what genres you like?. Great! Yes, I am looking for a movie recommendation. I typically enjoy dramas or indie films.. That's great! What was the last one you saw that you liked?. Hm, let's see. I saw Blinded By The Light and that was pretty enjoyable.. I saw that as well and really enjoyed it. My family is really into Bruce Springsteen. Are you interested in seeing movies with songs or different ones?. I enjoy movies with and without songs. I also saw The Farewell starring Awkwafina recently, which was good as well.. I've seen the trailers for that movie, it looks really good. I really liked Awkwafina's work in Ocean's 8. Have you seen Book Smart? I think it might be a movie you enjoy. I have not seen it yet, but I have heard of it and it does sound like something I would enjoy.. I would reccomend you watch the movie Lady Bird. It stars Saoirse Ronan and was nominated for 5 Oscars. It's a coming of age movie taking place in the early 2000's.. That sounds great! I'd love to see it.. I remember you said you like indie and drama. This movie also has a bit of comedy. Do you also enjoy comedies?. Yes, I enjoy some comedies. Mostly comedies with female leads.. Then you will love this movie. It is centered around a 17 year old girl and her relationships with friends and family. Would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Yes please!. Great! It also stars Timothe Chalamet. Fun fact, Timothe Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan are also in the upcoming film Little Women together. Do you think you will see that movie when it comes out?. You know, by golly, I just might!. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Awesome!

I definitely think that Mr. Rogers is someone who made the world a better place.. No I havent seen that movie but it sounds interesting, The last movie I have seen was Hacksaw Ridge. It was a true story about a man for fought without a weapon I believe during Vietnam. It was a great movie I would recommend seeing.. Nice! I have not heard of it before; I have to add it to my list--I am not super familiar with the wartime genre. However, my friend and I watched Letters from Iwo Jima together a couple of years ago. It's a World War II film, but it portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of two Japanese soldiers. It is in Japanese (I am a native English speaker) so be forewarned you may have to watch it with subtitles!. Cool. Thank you for the recommendation. I will have to watch that movie. Hopefully you will take my recommendation also. Thank you.. You are welcome! I'll definitely check out Hacksaw Ridge--it sounds like something my dad and I can watch together!. Thank you are.

I've seen that movie a long time ago, but I've forgotten a lot about the plot. I do remember that I liked it. Any other science fiction movies that you can recommend with a female lead?.

There was a fairly recent one that came out called Split, which also had a sequel called Glass. Have you heard of either of these?. I haven't. What are they about?.

You might like Awaken, though it is a few years old. The plot is based on a random group of people waking up on an island where they are being hunted down.. Great!

I did see the other Bad Boys. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch!. Great, I love movies. Anything you can recommend? I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently.. Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it?. Yes, I have seen it. Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. So was Anne Hathaway.. I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day. But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new! What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it?. I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk. Reminds me of my childhood.. Ah, the Avengers movies are so good! I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman. Have you seen that movie?. No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire.. I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!. Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?. He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies!. I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good.. Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think?. Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron. Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow? I enjoyed that character from The Avengers.

Definitely could have! Also recently watched that. Do you have a favorite director?. In the genre? Not really, big on Tarantino and Wes Anderson but think theyre a bit outside this scope. An Anderson gangster film would be...an awesome combination in my opinion. Some nice pastels lining the dark alleyways. Anyhow, I think I have a suggestion!

I am interested in a horror film that is in an ordinary place. Somewhere that typically doesn't have scary experiences.. Are you looking for jump scares or more suspenseful?. I think suspenseful is better. It from 2017 is the highest grossing horror movie of all time, would you be interested in it, or have you seen It before?. I have seen IT already. Bird Box is from 2018 with Sandra Bullock?. Was that a Netflix movie? I think I had heard good things about it. I have not seen that one.. Yes it is a Netflix film. I think you would enjoy it. It's in a ordinary place, it's suspenseful, and was made recently with a big name actor.. Yes, that surely sounds like a good match. Is there a basic plot description you could provide? I have no idea what it is about.. Five years after an ominous unseen presence drives most of society to suicide, a mother and her two children make a desperate bid to reach safety.. Dang, that does sound good. I think we have a winner!. Awesome that's great I hope you enjoy the movie, and you can do so in the comfort of your own home. I hope you have some popcorn ready!.

Thanks, the leading actor is really funny have you heard of Ryan Reynolds before_. Yes I have and he is hilarious. Do you recommend any sci-fi movies?. Yes of course, would you like recent movie trailer or older scif-fi movie trailers?. show me an older trailer. So a great movie is Avatar, it came out in the year 2009 and the director is James Cameron.. That sounds good. Do you recommend anything scary?. If you like scary movies then Annabelle will make you jump its based on a real life story, so just wondering out of all the recommendations which one will you watch first_. Out of all of these recommendations, I would first want to watch Fast and Furious Hobbs and Shaw.. ", ". Hello there, how are you doing?. Good I am looking for a trailer. What type of movies do you like best?. I love anything pre 2001, especially horror. I mean classic horror. Same here, I really like classic horror films. How about actors, any favorites?. I like a lot. In particular, I like John Cazale and Laurence Olivier, but they are not from any good horror movies. How about directors, any preferences?. Stanley Kubrick, John Landis. Good call, two of my favorites as well.. I like slashers, monster movies, ghost movies, all of the above really. Brian de Palma is great as well.. ", ". Hello! How are you?. Hey! I'm great, how about you? I am in the mood for a movie trailer.. Great! I love movies! What is the latest movie you have watched?. I watched Billy Madison while I was visiting my sister over Thanksgiving.. I love that movie! Adam Sandler and Chris Farley are the best! What did you like about it and what did you not like about it?. I also really like Adam Sandler, but not his newer movies. I liked that it was just silly funny. There was really nothing that I didn't like.. Would you like a recommendation for a movie similar to that one? I also prefer old Adam Sandler movies. They were more light hearted and real!. Yes, I really enjoyed it, so I would love something similar.. Are you a Will Ferrell fan as well? I love his comedies and they can be kind of similar to old Sandler movies!. I really don't like him. I know most people do, but he's not my jam. I kind of want an Adam Sandler one again.. Have you ever seen Happy Gilmore? It is from the same time period as Billy Madison and is a laugh riot!. YES, that is perfect!! I saw parts of it once at a party, but I couldn't remember what it was called! Thank you, I accept that recommendation!. It is a great movie. A classic Adam Sandler movie. It almost makes you forget all the recent ones he has tried to do!. Totally! Thanks, again!. No problem! I always enjoy recommending movies. I hope you enjoy it!. I'm sure I will! I've been trying to remember the name for a long time!. It is the movie that I consider to be closest to Billy Madison. It should make you laugh and root for the underdog! A great combo of a movie.. I love movies like that! I'm going to pop some popcorn!.

I prefer the horror movies that are less boo and more suspenseful rather than jumpy. What about you?. i completely agree!! There are some movies where the acting is just that bad. haha.. Yes, I can not stand when the acting is bad as well as the graphics. Good graphics are especially important in horror movies.. I agree. think that also includes the special effects when something looks fake, i think it ruins the entire movie. I love movies that make me jump and just can't look away. I also love horror movies that are based on true life events. Have you seen Truth or Dare? It seems like a really suspenseful movie that you might like!. I haven't heard of that.

Bad Boys is pretty straightforward, and while it's a fun trip, it's one we probably won't pay to see in theatres.. There aren't many superhero movies out right now, but you might enjoy Birds of Prey.

I am exhausted of superhero movies.. I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!. Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!. Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?. Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.. Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J. Thanks again! Have a good one :). ", ". Hi! I'm here to recommend you a movie trailer.. Hello!.

You may have turned me on to a new movie :) Are you looking for a movie to watch with kids? Are you looking for something similar to Frozen 2?. It was a really cute movie! My kids loved it! Yes! My kids and I do movies all weekend.. That's so nice! I loved movie nights growing up. Have you heard of the movie Troop Zero on Amazon Prime?. No I haven't heard of that one!. I haven't watched that one yet, but I just added it to my Watchlist. It has Viola Davis, Jim Gaffigan and Allison Janney in it. A great cast. If you're looking for a cartoon though, I think I would recommend Spies In Disguise. Did you catch that one yet?. No I haven't caught that one yet either! Troop zero is definitely going on my watch list! Cartoon is more for my family! My children are under 10 years old. I'll have to check out Spies in Disguise.

Have you seen The Final Wish?. Not yet. When is it showing? I like the genre of A Quiet Place... It out on DVD/Blu-Ray now but its a pretty good one. If you like A Quiet Place then you might the BirdBox.. Yess. Definitely! Awesome acting, as expected from the main actress, but the kids! Amazing, both in A Quiet Place. It is hard when acting is based only on facial expression and actions, not verbal scripts only. Well in Bird Box instead of not being able to speak they are unable to use their sight. Sandra Bullock is the main Actress with a little boy and a little girl. Have you seen Bird Box?. Yes. They were blindfolded all through out. It is kind of far fetched in reality but because the acting is good, you kind of what if you are in their places. Its like being totally blind literally..

Hello! What genre of movies do you love?. i love comedy movies the most. a good action movie once in a while as well. Ok, same here! What was the last comedy you watched and really liked?. i watched longshot earlier this year that i enjoyed quite a lot. has seth rogan and charlize theron in it. do you have a comedy movie recommendations?. Yes! What type of comedy doesn't appeal to you? And have you seen Blockers?. I like all types of comedy as long as it's not boring! I have no seen Blockers. Is it good?. ", ". ", ". hi!. Hi. what kinds of movies do you see in the theater, versus watching at home?. Hmm...I like seeing movies with friends in theaters whereas at home I prefer just to watch by myself. Usually in theaters it is a big blockbuster or something recent.. that big screen is a definite for big blockbusters! i take it action is your thing then? are you into the comic book movies that are popular now?. Not really into comic book based moveis. More into space or time travel movies.. oh yea! interstellar is a personal favorite of mine. have you seen donnie darko before? jake gyllenhaal is pretty young in it. I really liked interseller and donnie darko is one of my favorite films. Are there others like them you would recommend?. of course! time travel movies tend to fall on the funny or serious side, it sounds like a more serious one is up your alley. edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it?. I am not, though I like tom cruise movies.. this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about). Interesting. Did the movie have different names in different markets?. yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt. lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others?. looper is about time travelling to kill people (it's not as dark as that sounds), its a really interesting take on time travel with bruce willis and joseph gordon-levitt. not a spoiler, but joseph gordon-levitt plays a younger version of bruce willis. I saw looper and really liked it. Looper is a good recommendation. I also liked inception. Are there anymore like that?. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Yes! It is hilarious!

It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g. Well, the obvious choice is A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It's about Mr. Rogers.. Do we know how long that movie is. Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot.. That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated?. For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie. Oh nice. What is that one about?. It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too.. That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one. You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best.. I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids. ", ". How are you doing today?. Hey, I'm good! How are you?. Good just thinking about watching a movie. Have anything in mind?. I am a big Disney fan. I really like Wreck it Ralph because it talks about every day life.. I've never seen that movie, what's it about?. It is about video game characters that go into other games or the internet and do different things. It is a very cute movie. i have a young daughter who loves it.. That sounds like a cute movie. Have you seen Frozen 2 yet?. Yes it is a good movie but, my daughter is not into it. LOL. Aw! My 7 year old wants nothing to do with the old Frozen now that the second one is out. We tried watching it last night and she wasn't interested. Do you have any recommendations for any other movies my daughter and I could watch? We like Disney movies a lot too!. Another good Disney movie is Big Hero 6. It is kind of sad but, it has some good messages in them. My son likes robots so it is kind of about a smart kid that can build robotics.. That sounds like a good movie for us to watch. My daughter likes things like that! Thanks for the recommendation, we're going to watch that right now!. I hope you both enjoy. Even though I am grown we still watch the magic of Disney. LOL. I do too! They really do have a good messaged for kids and the movies are really cute!. Yes they are.

I'm a huge fan of horror films, but prefer more dread than gore. Do you have any suggestions?. What is your favorite horror film?. My favorite horror film would probably be The Shining. It's a unique story that keeps the viewer on edge the entire time. I love that over jump scares and senseless gore.. Ok, awesome. Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer?. Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already.. It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best.. Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as Hitchcock-ian?. I will do my best to find something you haven't seen!. Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film!. How did you feel about Split from M. Night? Did you find it too slow, or did that have the dread you're looking for?. I actually haven't seen that one yet. I also did not know Night made that one. Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about?. It's one of my favorites he's done so far. James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film.. 23 personalities! That sounds interesting. Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film? He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a bad guy before.. He's *mostly* the bad guy. The film is about a group of girls that are abducted and held hostage by a person with multiple personalities. One personality in particular - The Beast - has a plan for them. Some of the personalities side with The Beast, and some do not. It is the second film in the Unbreakable series, but different in style for sure. You don't need to know anything about Unbreakable to see Split, though.. Wow! That sounds like a psychological mind twist and definitely vintage Shyamalan. I will accept the recommendation and give it a watch! It sounds like it's right up my alley and deals more with dread and suspense. Thank you kindly!. ", ". Hello, how are you doing today?.

I'm great! How are you? I'm a huge fan of horror films - particularly those that deal more with dread than gore.. Oh man, I love horror movies! What have you seen recently that you liked?. The last horror film I saw and liked was A Quiet Place. Such a unique film that relied on silence!. I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different?. A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!. I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.. Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dread in horror. Can you explain to me what The Transfiguration is about?. The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster. You get to follow him through a snapshot of his story, and all of it is very dark.. That actually sounds like an intriguing and unique premise. Plus a fresh take on the vampire genre. Is it a newer film (like within the last 15 years)? Or older?. It came out in 2016 in the Cannes Film Festival from an Australian director. Haha, I had a Shudder account for a brief time and found it there while I was movie binging.. Was it well received at Cannes? I know just being accepted there tells me it should be a great movie!.

I kinda forgot about it, but thanks to your recommendation I may finally give it a chance. Not even kidding. Thanks!. no problem my pleasure have a great day. Same to you, fellow turkey. it seems we will have to finish a few more turns. Oh.Um Well Tom Hanks is in Inferno I see. He's probably my favorite actor ever. one of them at least. yeah i agree he is a big actor. Not too familiar with the other actors/actresses in it. Have you seen Inferno. ", ". hi, how are you doing today. well,yourself?. ", ". Hi how is your day. Hey there! It's been pretty good. I've been looking for something interesting to watch lately.. What kind of things do you like to watch.. I tend to lean more towards horror movies but I have a guilty pleasure for romantic comedy, too.. I love to watch horror movies myself! What is the last move that you have seen?. It's been awhile since I've watched a good horror movie. I think the last one that I watched was probably IT and I tend to watch the Scream movies over and over again. I like good horror movies that make you think, have good characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.. Those are the best kinds of movies when you are on the edge of your seat. I love that penny wise smile, nothing will ever compare to it. Have you ever seen any of the Insidious series?. I don't think that I have! Are they any good? What are they about?. They are one of my favorite scary movies. They all follow a different person every movie but it is about someone being taken into a different dimension of the world they live in.. That sounds like it perfectly describes a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just my kind of movie! I'd love to give them a try and start watching as soon as I can. Thanks for the recommendation!. They are a little bit of an older movie but I really enjoy them and will watch them over and over.. They sound like a perfect recommendation for me!.

I've thought of watching it maybe. It highly recommend it. Smith rarely disappoints. Another one would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood if you like Tarantino movies or Ford vs Ferrari for a combination historical/suspense movie.. I will definitely watch it soon then. Tarantino's movies are the best. Excellent. Enjoy! Good chatting with you.. good bye. I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view. I will try to view them. buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot. They occasionally do. From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover. There are enough other twists hidden in the movie.. my favorite movie of will smith is Men in black. but he also does serious movies also.. This will in line with his normal level of acting. Throwing in suttle humor while not losing the mood of the scene.. I'm just glad he is still in movies. I agree. It's fun to see long time actors also evolve into other roles. Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of BelAir to his movie roles now are night and day but it is still authentically him..

I haven't seen that one yet, what type of these genre's do you not like?. Romantic dramas, not my cup of tea. I find them to be kind of boring.. Haha, I understand that. Is there any movie trailers you would like to see?. Well, I heard there's a new James Bond movie coming out soon. I don't know if the trailer has been released or not.. Oh, I have heard that too.

I am interested in sci fi movies but horror are also acceptable. Have you recently watched a sci-fi or horror movie you enjoyed?. I have been watching alot of horror lately, IT chapter 2 was good. Stephen King provides some thrilling content for movies! Are you a fan of his?. Yea I have read alot of his work and seen most of his films, the new pet sematary was pretty decent and I am looking forward to the TommyKnockers adaptation. Agreed, it should be a good combination of science fiction and horror! What did you enjoy most about pet seminary?. It managed to stay true to the source material, whilst changing a few key elements to keep it fresh and update it for a new audience. Do you follow Stephen King on social media? He has a list of movies he personally recommends.. I didnt know that he did that, what kinds of movies does he reccomend. He recommends new indie horror movies to his fans, I'd recommend checking out The Autopsy of Jane Doe.. I loved the autopsy of jane doe it was one of my favorite new horror films. It's the #1 recommendation. I'd also recommend Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch 2. I havent seen Blair Witch 2 but I was not a big fan of the first one. Yeah, if you didn't enjoy the first one I'd stay away from it too. Have you seen STIR OF ECHOES?. I dont think I have, Kevin Bacon right?. Yes! It's a supernatural film based on a novel. I remember you said you like sci fi movies and this is based on a novel like Stephen King so it could be a good one to check out.. I will check out a trailer for it thanks I accept this recomenndation. Awesome! I'd also check out Stir of Echoes: The Homecoming, it came out in 2007 and is a thriller.. Isnt it based on a game too? or smething like that. ", ". hello, My name is Matt and i am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi Matt, nice to meet you!. nice to meet you aswell.

Have you seen the new Terminator Movie? they brohgt back Linda Hammiltton to repreice her role as Sarah Connor. Yes I did see it and loved it. I really like that they brought back Arnold and Linda for that movie. Underworld is my current favorite. Love movies about vampires and werewolves too.. How about Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman about the notorious monster hunter trying to stop Dracula,. Oh that sounds interesting. When was it released?. It came out on 2004. i like it a lot. the effects still hold up to this day and the story is actually really good, it has good twists and adventure. sounds like something I would like, thank you for the suggestion. Any other movies like that, that I might like?. I am Legend with Will smith, i like the version of vampires in this movie, vampires created by science in look for a cure for cancer. oh wow that sounds like a good storyline. Is that the one where he is all alone?. yes he is alone in Manhatthan, i like the relatioship between him Will Smith and his dog. Am a dog person. okay I will see about watching that one for sure. I do like will smith's movies so should be good. I always like him in I, Robot. I, Robot is an amazing film, if you liked him on that you will defenetly enjoy I am Legend. he has to carry most of the film on his own and the twist at the end is also good. i can only imaigine how hard it would be to carry that whole movie alive.. he does a graet job, the dog does well too.

Right?! He did an excellent job. I was also really surprised by Adam Sandler's performance, he did a great job as well.. Have you ever heard of GOOD WILL HUNTING?. I actually haven't, care to explain a little bit more about it or who is in it?. ", ". Hi there! I'm Jessica, I will help you find a movie that is perfect for you. How are you doing today?. Hi Jessica, I am Jen. Do you have any movie recommendations?. Hi Jen! That is my sister's name too :) I definitely have some recommedations. First, what was the last movie you watched that you really liked?. This past weekend I watched Ford vs Ferrari and I thought it was good.. Oh great! What an all-star cast that movie has. What were some aspects of the movie that you liked most?. I liked that was about actual events, had humor, and was exciting during the racing events. It was a drama, but thrilling.. ", ". Hi How are you today? I'm here to help you pick the perfect movie!. Hi! Awesome, thanks! I just saw the new movie A Day in the Neighborhood and didn't like it that much. It was a little too slow for my liking. I would love to see a new movie in theaters that is really engaging.. ok! Why was it too slow? Did you like the actors in it though? How was Tom Hanks?. yes it was, Tom Hanks played the part great though. I just liked him better in other movies.

My name is Jaime, nice to meet you. I like a variety of movies, but most recently I've enjoyed action or comedy. cool, talking about action have you seen the latest trailer for Terminator, they finally got James Cameron back along with Linda Hammilton back to the franchise. I haven't seen that trailor, Linda Hamilton is great. I'm always hesitant with remakes though. Have you seen it?. i have seen it, and it is not a remake, it is a direct sequel to T2. Oh thats cool. Did they replace Arnold?. no same Arnold, just older... tell you secret they even got the original John Connor back. You have me sold already. Did the trailer show how they were going to continue from the original?. that is the big twist... can't spoil it. Such suspense. I'll definitely give it a watch. As long as it doesn't have Daenerys in it I think it will be a good one.. lol, she is not in it. movie is good, way better that Terminator Genesys. Thanks for the recommendation :) I like your style. i appreciate that, i enjoy movies, specially if they dont suck, and this last Terminator definatly doesn't. it only took 20 years to make a good one again. James Cameron is a good one to have do it too. He is usually pretty spot on with the graphics and effects.. i agree, after avatar i did not think he would come back to the franchise but he did, i feel like he saw what they were doing and had enough. Ugh Avatar is a sore spot in movie history. Visually beautiful, but that was the longest painful watch. lol, i agree with you, i hope you really enjoy Terninator Dark Fate as i did. I think I will. I'll have to see where its playing. it sould be playing everywhere, i saw it at a drive in, and that is saying something. Oooh good idea, I've never been to a drive in. I know my plans now!. ", ". Hello Im here to help you with movie trailer recommendation how are you doing today?. Doing well thank you, hope you are well. I like movies based on reality. Do you mean movies based on real life stories?. Yes those tend to be my favorite. I also like action movies or dramas, not a big scifi fan. Oh I see, I like real life movies as well they leave me thinking. Yes, can relate to them more. I agree, have you seen the movie The Walk?. No I have not. Ok so the movie is based on real life events its about a man who is a high-wire artists and crosses the twin towers. ok, sounds interesting. It really is, that movie kept me on an edge the whole time.. Great I will check it out thanks. Ok, great, another recommendation I can give you is the movie Sully.. Yes I have seen that movie, excellent movie. It is excellent I agree, if you liked that one then you will enjoy The Imitation Game, have you seen that one?. I have not, what is that one about?. Ok then you have to watch that one first, its about a methematical genius who cracked and important code called Enigma, the cast is great and it won an Oscar. Oh ya I think I remember hearing about that but have never watched it, will give it a try. ", ". Hello!. Hi!. Have you seen any good movies lately?. A couple.

I really like the Terminator serier, but I have already seen the new one. I don't mind that type of science fiction, but it has been used up. I am looking for something more thought provoking.. i understand how about the dragon prnce on netflix fron the creators of Avatar theanimated series. Is that an anima? Because if it is, I believe I have already seen that one too.. it is, wow you know a lot about tv and movies too. I do watch alot of movies and netflix. I have kinda ran out of options.. how about Mother on Netflix, about a girl raised by a robot in a distopian future. I have seen that one too. It has a really good ending.. i agree, how about nine, its about a group of puppets in a post apocaliptic earth, i like it...its a bit old but it is amazing. That is a pixar movie. It came out awhile ago. It is very dark and kinda sad. I have seen that one too.. wow am impressed, i like it a lot, the realationships are what draws me to it. Similar to a movie called let me in with Chloe Moretz. I haven't seen that one.. it is a great movie. it is about a boy that gets bullied and befriends a child vampire and their relationship, as e ages and she won't. I think I like that recommendation.. i hope you do, it has a little suspense and it reminds me a little of Stranger Things how despite being kids the action is not childish.

Have you ever seen the movie princess bride?. Ahh, many times and have got so in some parts I tend to speak the dialog in my mind as the actor does.. It really is a great movie, what about Karate Kid?. Yep I have seen that one a couple times too. I like a lot of Tom Hanks movies such as Sleepless in Seattle and BIG.. ", ".

Hello. Hello, how are you?. well, and you?. Great, can yo help me with finding a movie trailer?. Absolutely. What genre of movies to you like?. Sci-fi and Action. Me too! What was the last movie you saw?. Avengers: Endgame. Nice! A great end to a huge series of movies!. I loved it.. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi I am looking for a movie trailer. I like anything that's a comedy.. What is the last movie you watched?. Burlesque (2010). Okay! Are you looking for a movie trailer similar to this (drama/romance) or still just comedy?. Just a comedy. I was really impressed with Where'd You Go Bernadette. I thought it was the perfect combination of funny and interesting.. Okay thank you for your help I will check it out!. Great! I watched it with some of my friends and we really enjoyed it. Kind of quirky as well. I hope you are able to enjoy it as well.. Thanks so much!. So would you like to watch the movie trailer?. Yes I would. I think you will really enjoy it! It has Cate Blanchett in it.. Thanks I will watch it!. Do you like mysteries?. Yeah I do. That is another reason why I enjoyed this movie. It's funny and has a little bit of mystery involved with it too. It's the perfect balance I think.. Yeah I watched the trailer and it looks really good im gonna watch it now. Thank you so much.. Of course! I am so glad that you are as intrigued as I was when I watched the trailer. I really hope you are able to enjoy the movie as well.. Yeah thank you so much, I had never heard of this movie before so i'm glad it was recommended to me.. I never had either, but once I watched the trailer I knew I had to watch it. Sometimes I have such a hard time finding a good quality movie. It's the ones you do not hear about that surprise you sometimes!. Yeah I know thanks again!. No problem! I was surprised that I had never heard of it and especially becasue Cate Blanchett is in big movies such as Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Ocean's 8, etc. She really is a great actress I think. Do you like movies like Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones?. Yeah i do I haven't watched all of the movies in each series but ive seen some from each and I really like them.. That's how I am too! Especially with Harry Potter and Star Wars movies. They are not really part of my favorite genre, but I have watched a few from each series. Have you watched Harry Potter or Star Wars?. Yeah Ive seen all of the Harry Potter movies but i've seen only some of the Star Wars movies. I really like both franchises though.. I am the opposite. I have seen only some of Harry Potter and almost all of Star Wars. I think they both are a nice change. Yeah I really like both. It's interesting to see how Star Wars paved the way for a story like Harry Potter, their plots both follow the cycle of the hero's journey.. Yes isn't that interesting? I am glad that someone else sees that connection as well. Both are a great series, just takes a long time to finish them!. Yes I think both series also set a standard for having multiple sequels to movies now, mostly as a cash grab, since I don't think their have been many series that have come out recently that are that interesting. I think after Hunger Games we haven't really had any good movie series come out that weren't piggybacking off of the Hunger Games dystopia hype.. Yes I agree! It is crazy how hard it is to find a quality movie these days because of the great movies that were made in the past.. Yes especially with all of the reboots too!. ", ". Hello!. Hi, how are you?.

Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version.

I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie?. The Shining was solid.

I love watching zombie movies and this movie is quite different from other movies of this kind because it isn't dark.....it brings in comedy and is more fun. I like the actors too, they have great synergy with one another and makes it more enjoyable to watch. That's a creepy and definitely a good one! The actors in that one are good!

Are you wanting to watch something along the same lines as Zombieland or do you want to reach for something different this round?. I could definitely go for something different this time around. I like watching different types of movies. Have you ever seen or heard of A Haunted House? its definitely a good comedy with a little fantasy to it and it's not overly cheesy either.. Yes I have heard of A Haunted House and would consider watching it. So I accept your reccomendation.. Thats great! Check out the movie trailer and hopefully you'll love the movie!!. Yeah the trailer looks funny!. Im glad. sometimes I just watch the trailer for a good laugh!. Hahaha true. I'm a fan of the Wayans brothers and I find them to be wicked funny. Are you a fan of them?. ", ". Hi! Do you like movies about space?. yeah a lot.. Okay great! How about movies with some action and drama?. very much ,i always feel engaged on the act.. Well, there's a movie out called Rise of Skywalker. It's part of the Star Wars franchise. Would you like to see the trailer for it?. Oh yeah i very interested to check it out. ", ". Hi, my name is John.. Hi my name is Mel. Do you have any movie recommendations?. Yes, I am happy to help you find something you would like. Do you like action movies?. Sometimes as long as there is good character development. Ok so you like character development, that's helpful. What was a recent movie you really enjoyed?. the avengers series. Ah, the cast is wonderful in those, especially Robert Downey Jr. Are you looking for a super hero type movie then?. He was my favorite. I like action but not typically at the forefront of the movie. Maybe something with Robert Downey Jr. too. He has always been my favorite. Ok, and do you have a preference on genre with RDJ? Or as long as he is in it?. Pretty much as long as he is in it is good. I would recommend Sherlock Holmes. It stars Robert Downey Jr, was nominated for two Oscars, has action, drama, a little bit of everything!. That sounds great, I will definitely take that recommendation. Thanks!. Perfect. I can get that trailer sent over to you. It came out in 2009 so it's not new. Is that okay?. that sounds great. Ok. Would you like to know anything else or similar titles?. is there a sequel to the movie?. Yes! There is. I would recommend watching that following this.. perfect i will jump in!.

I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times.. okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre?. I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind.. That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it.

Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character..

Definitely could have! Also recently watched that. Do you have a favorite director?. In the genre? Not really, big on Tarantino and Wes Anderson but think theyre a bit outside this scope. An Anderson gangster film would be...an awesome combination in my opinion. Some nice pastels lining the dark alleyways. Anyhow, I think I have a suggestion!

Which one did you like better?. wrath of Kahn he was more menacing, into darkness he just seemed angry, i would say wrath of Kahn.

I haven't watched both of them. I have heard about Nightcrawler. I will try to watch.. Tom Hardy is great and has some amazing action/thriller films he is in as well.. He is great. His voice is more unique.. He starred in Locke, and the film is just him in a car the entire time; it's actually brilliant.. Really I am going to watch tonight.. Wonderful!

Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together.. Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see?. We both like action movies :). Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ?. The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little.... Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. Yes, a similar one please :). I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead.. We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it?. okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray. Yes please :). Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties.. Of course :). while I'm waiting I want to see what other movies especially comedy do yall like?. We saw the sequel to Zombieland recently! I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it! Especially the midcredit scene :P. ", ".

It was filmed in 2015 and won awards for outstanding visual effects!. hmm, sounds interesting, I have not seen this movie before, do you have any other reccomendation?. ", ". Hello. Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you?. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style?. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.. Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being. Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.. The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play.. I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.. ", ". Hi, how are you?. I am supper, thank you.. What kind of movies do you like?. I like marvel movies.. Those are great ones, whay is your favorite thing about them?. I am a avid comic book collector and have many iron man, hulk, avenger comics.. That's pretty cool. What is your favorite movie?. My favorite would have to be the avenger series..

I am here to help you find a movie to watch.. I am looking for an action type movie. Do you like superhero movies?. I do, but I was thinking something more spy thiller. James Bond movies are a great option for that, and there are a ton of those movies to choose from.. I like Bond, maybe one of the older one's. What is your favorite one?. My personal favorite is Casino Royale, one of the more contemporary ones. However, Goldfinger is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old!. I like that one, where he robs the Federal Reserve. Sweet, good choice, that is what I will go with, Goldfinger. I'm glad to hear that! I hope you enjoy it.. Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night.. It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think Casino Royale would be a great second choice if that works for you. In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery.. I think that will work, as that particular one does a good job channeling the older Bond films. Thanks for the effort, and recommendation.. Of course, it was my pleasure.. Have you seen the Bond where he gets married? It is the one with the one-off Bond actor, in-between Connery and Moore. I dont think I have, what year did it come out?. 69, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. He is seen as the Bond closest to the character based in Fleming's Books about Bond. ", ". Hi buddy. What is the last movie you watched?. Hi! I recently watched once upon a time in hollywood. What was your favorite part of the movie?. I really enjoyed the character development and the idea that the entire time I thought I would know the ending as it followed the Manson murders, but it had a plot twist!. So, you like movies with plot twists?. I do, I do not enjoy movies where I can guess the endings. I recommend the movie The Game starring Michael Douglas. Ok great, why do you think so?. It has not one, but many different plot twists.. that's awesome. I will check the movie out!. Got it. Is there anything else that you enjoy about The Game?.

Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting.. I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking!

The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie.

Its very interesting and there are some emotional scenes. Its about a robot and a guy named Hiro who forms a team of heros. Ok, interesting. I'm looking for something to relax with and get lost in. That might work. its called big hero 6. it doesnt have a typical children's movie plot but its family friendly and fun to watch. Ok.

Romantic Comedy is a good genre. The wife and I watch those together often.. is there a particular actor you like?. Not necessarily. I'm open to any actors as long as they are decent. DeCaprio, Hanks, Smith..Pitt, any of them are always pretty watchable.. What was the last action movie you saw?. I just finished watching World War Z with Brad Pitt, although I've seen it a few dozen times! The last action movie would probably have been Skyscraper with The Rock. They were both great movies. mine was frozen 2 haha. Ahh, you probably have little ones. My daughter was into the original frozen, but has NO interest in Frozen 2..she's WAY too cool for it, lol.. nope my kids are now older but it was enjoyable. I may have to watch it..I'll probably end up watching it eventually, no way to avoid all these disney movies, lol. exactly! Do you enjoy going to the movies and seeing new releases or on TV (a home).

I'm open to any actors as long as they are decent. DeCaprio, Hanks, Smith..Pitt, any of them are always pretty watchable.. What was the last action movie you saw?. I just finished watching World War Z with Brad Pitt, although I've seen it a few dozen times! The last action movie would probably have been Skyscraper with The Rock. They were both great movies. mine was frozen 2 haha. Ahh, you probably have little ones. My daughter was into the original frozen, but has NO interest in Frozen 2..she's WAY too cool for it, lol.. nope my kids are now older but it was enjoyable. I may have to watch it..I'll probably end up watching it eventually, no way to avoid all these disney movies, lol. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Same here. Will Ferrel is great.

Okay sounds good. We still have to talk back and forth for several more turns. So let me ask you. Have you seen the old version of It?. Oh, I did not realize. I actually did see the 1990 version (on TV). Which one do you think is better - new or old?. Well I think the new version is creepier in my opinion. But not sure the chapter II is that good.. Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot. I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it!. I definitely will check it out - are you a Stephen King fan?. Yes of course! I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie?. The Shining was solid. Obviously, the Jack Nicholson version was a classic. A favorite definitely. I also liked a little known TV film and book called Rose Red...underrated.. Great! I see you and I have a lot in common! I feel exactly the same about the Shining. Though I don't know much about Rose Red, it sounds great too.. I love the Shining, but of the recommendations, right now, I think I will definitely stick with IT. Any others you think I may like?. I am sorry but we don't have the trailer for IT. Would you care for Doctor Sleep? It is about The Shining. Oh, Doctor Sleep sounds amazing. I have heard great things...and honestly, forgot about it. That would be great if you have the trailer.. Yes. I highly recommend it. The little boy from the Shining is fully grown in this one. Sounds cool huh?. I heard a little about the plot. Ewan McGregor lead, right?. ", ". Well, hello there!.

Greetings, I understand you are looking for movie recommendations.. Yes, I am. What do you recommend?. What types of movies are you interested in?. Good question. Some days I like sci-fi & fantasy, others I like drama.. What was the last movie you saw?. The last movie I saw was Zombieland: Double Tap.. Got it, I think I have a couple options you might like. When you watch a movie, do you often also watch the sequel if one comes out?. It depends. I think with how frequent sequels have become, I've lost interest in keeping up with watching the sixth, seventh, etc. iteration of primarily the same story.. One I might recommend is Joker, it is a type of sequel, but really looks to look peer into a character from a different perspective.. That is a good recommendation, I've seen it.. Since you've already seen it, would you like another recommendation?. I would, actually. Thank you.. Well, it is not quite out yet, and it is the umpteenth release in a series, but if you've seen all of the initial Star Wars movies, I would recommend the trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. With the Star Wars series being what it is, I find it will be a must-see movie as someone who appreciates Sci-fi.. Star Wars has been a series I've kept up most with, repeatedly watching the original trilogy as a child. I will definitely check it out..

Hello hello, I here you are looking for a good movie to watch. Is there a specific genre you like?. Hi, I like to watch comedy films. What about you?. I prefer true crime movies, thank you for asking. But comedy is really good, too. Do you have a specific comedian you prefer?. I like a lot of women comedians with raunchy humor, like Ali Wong. Raunchy humor huh? That's interesting. Are you a fan of Amy Schumer? I would recommend watching Trainwreck.. I saw that film and I enjoyed it. Have you seen the Irishman on Netflix? I think you might like it. I have not seen Irishman, but I'm a fan of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I'll have to check that out. Would you refer a movie that's on netflix?. Sure if you want. I also like foreign language comedy films. Foreign Language. Well, I would recommend High Tension. It's a horror film, so a little bit of me, and a little bit of you.. Okay, well thanks. I dislike horror films, can you recommend anything else?. Sure. Have you seen Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. It's a 1988 film staring Antonia Banderas. Its about a series of heightened womanly dilemmas, with a little bit of sexual politics added in. That sounds great. I haven't seen it. I will check it out.. Something a little more light hearted is Klown its a 2012 film with a little bit of HBO's Curb your Enthusiasm added in.. Okay, cool. I like Curb Your Enthusiasm. I'll check it out, thanks!. And if you are looking for something that can pull at your heart strings, I would also recommend My Life as a Dog, from Sweden. Its a coming of age movie, very thought provoking. It goes into childhood wonder and how we have to realize the inevitable as we grow up, such as how to deal with death and heartache.. Oh, cool, I heard that is good. Have you seen Babylon Berlin on Netflix? I thought it was pretty good. It's about crime in Weimar Germany. It's in my queue, actually. Thank you for the recommendation! I'll have to watch that!. Yeah, I thought the design and costumes were really good. Apparently it was one of the most expensive Netflix films ever to produce. ", ". Hello how are you? Have you seen any good movies lately?.

Sure, a comedian named Arthur Fleck slowly begins a downward spiral as he is bullied in society.. sounds great. i'll check out Joker. thanks for the recommendation. Yes, it's still playing in theaters.. is joker the superhero of the movie?. He is a villain, but it shows his downward spiral to become the character who opposes Batman. are there any superheros in this movie? that's what I'm interested in. ", ". HELLO THERE.

It's similar to A Quiet Place but different enough to be interesting so you dont feel like youre watching the same movie again. It's less focused on the quiet elements but features a good bit of mysterious fantasy creatures and a general sci-fi mystery plot. I do accept this recommendation and can not wait to see. Thank you very much!. You'll like it. But if I may make another suggestion. Don't Breathe is also great within this genre. This title would be more of a suspenseful, quiet, with lots of scares and a less involved plot.. I can view the first recommendation and look into this other Don't Breathe as the next movie to watch.

I recently saw the film Jojo Rabbit, which is basically a satire of WWII. Long story short, they could have made the film insensitive in so many ways, but it was actually really good. Ooh, I haven't heard of that! I like satire, that sounds like a good one.. Yes, I highly recommend it. It has just the right amount of humor. Rebel Wilson is even in it!. No way! I just watched the trailer. I accept this recommendation. Thanks!. ", ". hello!! how are you today? what kind of movies do you like to watch?. Hi there. I'm well. Thanks for asking. I like a lot of different kinds of movies, but I'm especially in the mood for a good Christmas movie.. That's lovely to hear may i make a suggestion? to you i used to love watching it as a kid every December with my family.. I'd love to hear any suggestions you might have. Watching movies together was always a holiday tradition for us as well.. rudolph the red nosed reindeer original claymation film. was a family favorite of ours and the original animate Grinch was my favorite as a kid. i feel it has alot built in to the 2 films with american Christmas culture. Those are two of my favorites for sure. But I'm looking for something a little different. Not a cartoon. And nothing too cheesy. Something that's more comedy than drama.. ", ". hi. hello!. how are you today?. very good and you?. I am great. Do you like movies?. I'm superfan of it. what is the last movie that you watched?. jojo rabbit. I have no heard of that movie. it was an oscar nominee.. its about world war two. oh nice that sounds like an intersting movie. What other kinds of movies do you like?. I like comedy, can you recommend me any good one?. The hangover is a really funny comedy. you are right. mrs. doubtfire is another good movie. I would love to watch it... do you have another in mind?. instant family. thank u so much for your recommendations, I will check them out.

Hi there!. Do you know what kind of movies do you like?. I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers. I also love horror! I am not a fan of action films or romance much..

I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake!. I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic! I think the casting was perfect. oh my gosh YES! I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect. Did you see Get Out or Us? What did you think? I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes. I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me.. Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world.. and her voice?! Holy crap. That and her physical movements. I thought that was such a standout performance. Apparently she didn't tell anyone she was doing the voice like that until they started rolling and the other actors were absolutely terrified.. She is amazing! based on your taste in films, i would recommend A Quiet Place,. Wonderful. I absolutely adored A Quiet Place. The fact that they used a deaf actress and sign language was fantastic.

What is that movie about?. to quickly sum it up. dicaprio is playing a character who basically impersonates a bunch of different careers and ends up forging bank notes and illegally making money. he can outsmart anyone in order to be successful.

That's definitely a classic, and one of my personal favorites as well. Sounds like you appreciate movies that are witty as well as goofy.. Yes, I think that's a good assessment of my taste!.

If you don't like the sound of a movie, or find the description incredibly appealing, let me know - it will help me calibrate to your tastes and hopefully find you some great trailers you will like!. Thank you so much for your help!. OK - my first recommendation is Being John Malkovich. It's set in current day, and definitely incorporates a surreal element. The premise is that John Cusack finds a portal that leads him into the mind of movie star John Malkovich - who plays a dramatized version of himself. He does a great job and seems to have a lot of fun with the role. It was nominated for three Oscars.. That sounds really interesting, I like the surreal elements..

What stuff did you like in Frozen 2 and what stuff didn't you like?. I like the animation and the comedy, I like nice looking movies. I didn't like the weak story.. Are animated movies a big draw for you?. I think so, I like animation as a medium form.. Are there any particular voice actors that you like in animated movies, or is it more just about the quality of the story?. I think it's more about the quality to me, I don't care much about who's in a movie.. ", ". Hi! Do you like movies about space?. yeah a lot.. Okay great!

I think you will definitely like it!. sure.i am looking forward to see the trailer,it will be fascinating to watch.. It really will! I just know you will want to see the movie after seeing this!. yes,definitely,the way you have described it seems to be cool. Oh you know, if you like older movies I did want to mention Independence Day. It's got everything in it that you like too!. Really ,thats very nice to hear. Yeah, there's been a sequel to it just like Star Wars so you can watch more than one.. thank you for the recommendation i like it.

I've been looking for something interesting to watch lately.. What kind of things do you like to watch.. I tend to lean more towards horror movies but I have a guilty pleasure for romantic comedy, too.. I love to watch horror movies myself! What is the last move that you have seen?. It's been awhile since I've watched a good horror movie. I think the last one that I watched was probably IT and I tend to watch the Scream movies over and over again. I like good horror movies that make you think, have good characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.. Those are the best kinds of movies when you are on the edge of your seat. I love that penny wise smile, nothing will ever compare to it. Have you ever seen any of the Insidious series?. I don't think that I have! Are they any good? What are they about?. They are one of my favorite scary movies. They all follow a different person every movie but it is about someone being taken into a different dimension of the world they live in.. That sounds like it perfectly describes a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just my kind of movie! I'd love to give them a try and start watching as soon as I can. Thanks for the recommendation!. They are a little bit of an older movie but I really enjoy them and will watch them over and over.. They sound like a perfect recommendation for me!. The movie has had 8 wins and 15 nominations for awards.. How do you feel about the acting in the movie? Is it cheesy or do they do a nice job?. They did a very nice job acting and selecting the actors and actresses for the movie.. Okay, awesome. I think you had me at being taking into different dimensions I love this suggestion. Thank you!. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. Hi, thanks for your help. No Problem! Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. Either a recent drama or a comedy. Okay, Sounds like fun! What is the last movie that you watched?. Hmmm, I think it was The Santa Clause lol. Nice! Getting into the holiday spirit! I was thinking about A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It is a story based off of Mister Rodgers and is played by Tom Hanks. It looks quite inspiring and uplifting. A feel good movie.. Aww, I loved his show when I was younger. I actually think I'd like to see that movie.. I was thinking about this movie trailer because he does have a major cultural impact on America and fits how you like drama movies and I am sure it is fun and humorous. I think it's a good recommendation. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Sure, I'll watch it. Thank you! Hope you have a great day!. you too, thanks!.

I'm looking for something sort of action-y, but with an intelligent plot and some comedy. I really really liked RED and RED 2, for example.. Do you want a movie with similar story or a different one?. Similar would be cool. Spy movies are awesome!. I enjoyed The Operative. The plot was innovative, nuanced, and entirely credible. How does that sound?. It looks really cool. I accept the recommendation!. Excellent! Diane Kruger gives a quietly intense, steely performance in this action thriller.. Yeah! I like what I see so far plot wise... but I also see it's kinda lowly ranked on Rotten Tomatoes. Perhaps something with a higher rating but similar in style?. Okay, What is the last movie that you watched?. Un-related, but I watched Jojo Rabbit in theaters. I enjoyed it. Oh yes that movie was pretty funny.. It was funny, but it also was sad. I hated that Jojo's mother died.. That was a difficult scene. I remember you said you like spy and action movies. The Angel has fallen is about Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler who framed for the attempted assassination of the President. It also has Morgan Freeman in it.. Yeah! I saw it semi recently and it was pretty good. Good recommendation!. Great! Have you seen Domino yet?. I have not! It looks right up my ally plotwise, so despite the low rotten tomatoes rating, I accept the recommendation!. The movie has more visual spark than most of the blockbusters rolling off the assembly line this summer. It is about a Copenhagen police officer named Christian who seeks justice for his partner's murder by an ISIS member. Sounds great. I wanna watch it.. ", ". Hello, how are you!?. Hello! How is it going today?. I'm not too bad myself. Hope things are well with you!. Thank you, I am doing well.. Glad to hear it! Just curious, but what is the last movie that you watched?. Hmm, the last movie that I watched was on Netflix. It was a Comedy. I love comedy movies! Do you recall with it was titled?. I really can't remember. I'm terrible with names!. That is perfectly ok! What did you most enjoy about the movie?. It had a lot of funny moments. Oh! I remember that it had the handsome guy who used to be a wrestler..

I thought about asking my fiance about going and seeing it.. ", ". Hey! How's it going?. Very good! How about yourself?. Doing well. I hear you are interested in movies?. I love movies! Definitely one of my passions. Same! It's what my degree is in, actually. Do you have a favorite genre?. I like indie and coming of age stories. I'm also always down for a good horror film.. Have you seen the film Us? Got some interesting family dynamics, which is also important in all of the good coming of age films, etc. Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie vibe, etc. Think you might like it!. Yes I did see it! I thought Lupita Nyongo's performance was amazing. And definitely agree about the family dynamics part.. Got it. Nice! The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a psychological thriller kind of way... Ever seen Pi by Darren Aronofsky?. No I haven't! But I love psychological thrillers, what's that one about?. Seen ANY Aronofsky films? They all have some thematic similarities. Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly.. yes! I've seen Black Swan and Mother! Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling. I definitely suggest Pi then. It's a little more claustrophobic than Black Swan, but in a way that suits the obsession theme well.. it sounds so good. I definitely am interested in that and accept that recommendation. Sounds great! Enjoy! I wrote a scholarly article on Aronofsky and am definitely a fan. I hope you are too! Check out all of his stuff once you get time to.. I absolutely will.

I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that. Well I recently watched Call me by Your Name, and it was beautiful; both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning. May I tell you a little about it ?.. that doesnt really seem like its my style. well theres the Kevin Costner movie, Three days to Kill.. thats full of action, as he and his estranged daughter reconcile,, its quite thought provoking,, ;-).

Great ! The story follows Buck, a domestic dog who finds himself in the wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the late 1800s.

I watched it with my best friend, and we kept talking how we relate to the friendship of the main character and the dog .. Yeah and I just recently got a dog so it will be a great movie to see. Plus Harrison is such a great actor. he really is! Such an epic voice. well you said you like action pics , so you can't get more action than this !. Exactly I am really excited to see it!. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. I already did watch the trailer. Think about how awful it would be to get lost in the woods, with all that cold, snow and limited food..... doesnt seem that awful if you have a cute dog with you haha!.

Hey Alex, any movie recommendations?. I like to watch older movies. any monty python movies or lethal weapon movies are great. Love Lethal Weapon flicks! Only saw Monty Python and Holy Grail but loved it!. They are classics. I saw naked gun for the first time in a while the other night. Also saw Scarface for the first time last week. What movies have you seen recently?. Both excellent flicks but vastly different haha! I love older flicks as well. Saw three Oclock High and Doctor Sleep! Both solid flicks!. I have never seen those ones, I got to check them out. What do you like about those movies?. One is classic 80s comedy, the other was a solid sequel to the Shining! Very well made and I am a sucker for Horror! Well. Gotchu, I gotta check those out but I should watch The Shining first. I surprisingly have never seen it although I always hear about it. I love horror as well. Have you seen Amityville horror?. Not in a long time!!! I would like to watch that! Not sure how to do it but I accept that recommendation haha!!. ", ". Hi there! I'm here to assist you with finding a movie!. Awesome. How are you doing?. Pretty good, can't complain! How are you doing today?. Doing fine. My first task here. Just living my life best I can.. That's great to hear! I love it, I'm trying to do that as well for the new year. What was the last movie you have watched?. A series actually. Rocky, watched all of them just because I enjoy rewatching them.. Oh, that's very nice! Sylvester Stallone is an amazing actor. Is action your favorite type of genre for movies?. Not necessarily, though I do enjoy it. I'd say romantic comedy is my favorite next to scifi.. Sweet, I'm more of a rom-com kind of person as well. Would you like to watch a movie that is a romantic comedy?. Yeah, I'll definitely be willing to hear your recommendation(s).. To All the Boys I Loved Before is a very sweet film with some cute comedy involved. It's a Netflix original that will have your heart melted and also, tears from laughing so much. I remember watching this with my partner and it really was enjoyable for the two of us. In addition, Noah Centineo is an upcoming actor himself. I've been seeing him in a couple of shows and movies after watching this one!. That sounds like it would be up my alley. Thank you for taking the time out to explain what the movie is about and your recommendation. I will most definitely be checking it out!. Awesome to hear!. Any other movies I should check out?. ", ". Hi! How are you! I'm here to help you find a cool movie trailer to watch! What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. Hello! I like Comedy, Heroes and History Movies. Awesome! When you say history movies, do you mind if they are war movies?. I used to like war movies but now I like them about 20%. Okay! What kind of heroes do you like? Do you like the Marvel/DC Universe type heroes? Or are you open to other kinds? For example, have you heard of I Am Number Four?. Yes I like the Marvel heroes. Never heard of I am Number Four. Awesome! I am Number Four is an exciting and gripping movie about these persons that have powers called legacies. It is based off of a book series. The movie received a lot of good reviews from people that enjoy hero and action. Watching the film actually made me read the series. The trailer is here, if you want to check it out and let me know what you think!. How Many series are there?? And yes I can check the trailer.. This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic. OH wow the movie look very interesting, I wanna see it. Do you have any other recommendation?. Yes! Have you ever seen the movie Hancock with Will Smith? It is an awesome movie about a homeless superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers responsibly, and his growth as he becomes a better superhero.. Yeah I have seen That one.. Awesome! That was a fun movie. Speaking of fun, have you heard about the new Eddie Murphy comedy coming out? It is called Dolemite Is My Name. I am putting it up in a recommendation if you would like to check it out!. Yes i have heard of it. And yeah go ahead. Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named The King that is available on Netflix! It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast.. What is the movie (The King) about??.

I am not, though I like tom cruise movies.. this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about). Interesting. Did the movie have different names in different markets?. yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt. lol.

I am looking for a good movie to watch. I really like anything other than war movies or movies where animals die. Any reccomendations?. I really like To All the Boys I've Loved Before!:). Hmmm, I have never heard about that. What genre is it? Plot good?. It's a high school romantic movie! It'sreally good! If romantic movies aren't your thing I like Ralph Breaks the Internet! It's a super happy movie!. I do like a good romantic movie. I think I will check out your reccomendation! Thank you.. No problem!:). Have a good night!. You too!. Oh, by the way, what year was this movie released?. 2018! The sequel (To All the Boys: PS 1 Still Love You) came out this year. Great. I tend not to like older movies (pre-1985). I will have to check out the sequel also!. I'm glad! :) Do you have any other questions?. I don't think so. Thanks for all the help!. No problem!. Sorry, actually I have to know, are romantic movies your favorite?. Yeah! I'm a big softy :) Are romantic movies your favorite?. Definetely, some of my favorite. Especially romantic comedies. I have to admit I even love me some cheesy Hallmark movies. Do you ever watch any of those?. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie to watch! What kinds of movies do you usually like?. Sounds great. I'm most interested in romantic comedies.. Those are great, what is your favorite?. I love Bridesmaids, because it's hilarious.. I've seen that one, that is a really funny movie. Do you like Kristen Wiig in any of her other movies?. To be honest, I'm not really familiar with her other movies. But she was really funny in Bridesmaids. I liked the scene where she's attending her friend's wedding dress fitting because it really made me laugh. It felt like I could really relate.. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch.. I am looking for an action type movie. Do you like superhero movies?. I do, but I was thinking something more spy thiller. James Bond movies are a great option for that, and there are a ton of those movies to choose from.. I like Bond, maybe one of the older one's. What is your favorite one?. My personal favorite is Casino Royale, one of the more contemporary ones. However, Goldfinger is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old!. I like that one, where he robs the Federal Reserve. Sweet, good choice, that is what I will go with, Goldfinger. I'm glad to hear that! I hope you enjoy it.. Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night.. It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think Casino Royale would be a great second choice if that works for you. In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery.. I think that will work, as that particular one does a good job channeling the older Bond films. Thanks for the effort, and recommendation.. Of course, it was my pleasure.. Have you seen the Bond where he gets married? It is the one with the one-off Bond actor, in-between Connery and Moore. I dont think I have, what year did it come out?. 69, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. He is seen as the Bond closest to the character based in Fleming's Books about Bond. Thats interesting, considering it seems very out of his playboy character to get married.. Definitely, it is a different Bond, in tone. If you like Bond, and want a goofy version check out, In Like Flint, reminds me of an early Austin Powers.

I like old movies. As far as comedy I would pick Police Academy old but very funny. On the drama side I would say The notebook. What is Police Academy about, I've never heard of in it. Any known actors?. I am not sure how old you are but Steve Guttenberg and Kim Cattral are in it. Move is about a group of misfits and how they join a Police Academy and it follows them in training and later in job as cops on the streets.. Yes, I am familiar with Kim Cattral. Sound like a great reccomendation! I will definitely watch! Thak you!!!. This had few movies but start with 1st one for sure. Can't wait to see it! Thanks. on the current day I would say Schitt's Creek. What is that about? Sounds pretty awkward lol. This is a show about a rich family that got rubbed by the accountant and they are forced to go live in a tiny town that they purchased as a joke. They live in a motel. But you have to hear them talk and follow the life in this town. I am watching this for a second time in a year and love every minute of it.. Oh wow, sound interesting!. You can find it on Netflix 1-5 seasons and 6th is on POPtv for now but I am sure it will be on Netflix soon. Searching now!. ", ". Hello! I am here to give you some recommendations!

The recent film I saw in theaters was Web of Death.. Oh, so you like horror genres?. It's a fantasy martial arts film with some spooky elements.. What kind of genre are you interested in?. Something fun. I enjoy comedies.. Have you hear about The King's Man?. It hasn't been on my radar. I enjoy Matthew Vaughn's films.. He is the one who made The King's Man and it is honestly really good.. That sounds great!. Would you like to see the trailer?. Yes I would like to see that trailer. Thanks.. No problem!. That's all. Thank you very much for you help.. The movie is about a war to wipe out millions and one man must race against time to stop them.. Sounds like exciting stuff. I also like the period setting.

Haha, those are some classic funny guys. One more question then I think I have some recommendations. You watching with any kids or just adult comedies?. Just adult comedies.. One I have enjoyed with Will Farrell is The Other Guys. Hilarious cop comedy with him and Mark Wahlberg.. Yes, I love that one! It's very funny.. It is! I assume you have already seen Step Brother as well. Have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. I actually haven't seen either of them.

I am send you a trailer for the first one so you can make sure it's the one for you.. Ok, thank you.. I'm not sure why but the combination of Mark Wahlberg's seriousness and Will Farrell's comedy pair up well.. I agree! They complement each other well..

I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan but maybe I'd enjoy the films.. Perhaps based off your enjoyment of Harry Potter you like a more fantasy style of action. I really love to watch Lord of the Rings with my family. It is a very wild and action filled plot set in another world with magic. Do you think those movies would interest you?. Absolutely! I've seen them and although lengthy, I was captivated and enjoyed them a lot. I also am interested in anything about King Arthur or Merlin. Amazing! I feel like we have similar tastes so I would like to recommend Mortal Engines for you to view.. Really? Mortal Engines. I have never heard of it but on your advise, I would check it out.. In is based off a book like the movies you have previously mentioned. You follow a girl in a post-apocalyptic world trying to fight for a better world. Do you think you would watch this movie trailer?. Yes! It interests me.. Perfect! You have a great taste in movies and I think that you may really enjoy this movie.

Thats great! Movies that have awards or have higher ratings are always give more of an incentive to watch.. I agree, it is also more interesting if it is based on a true story.

Sorry boss. Just excited to hear what you have to recommend -- that's why we're here after all. The most recent film I watched was 1917. I quite liked it.. Have you seen any other Steven King movies?. I love Shawshank Redemption.. That's always a classic. Have you watched The Shining?. I have not. I'm familiar with the here's Johnny meme though.. Well, I'd definitely recommend it as the new Doctor Sleep film that's just come out is a sequel and expecting to be amazing.. Oh, I didn't know that! I'll have to check it out.. Definitely suggest it. Do you have any favorite series or producer otherwise?. Iain Smith is a favorite producer of mine.. ", ". Hello. I am here to recommend a movie for you today. What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. Hi. Hello. What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. Godzilla. Godzilla is a good movie. I like it too.. What are you doing?. I am here to recommend you a film. Since you like Godzilla, you might enjoy Cloverfield or Pacific Rim. Yes l like thus movie. Excellent. I enjoy those films too.

That sounds like a good plan. Yeah its a good plan. Any other films you enjoy watching?. I watch fast and furious. Bro, I love the Fast and Furious franchise. Such a good film. I miss Paul Walker though.. I also miss you Paul Walker.. ", ". Hi! How is your day going?. So far so good, thanks for asking!. Glad to hear it. I'm here to help you find a new movie. What are you interested in lately?. A good western would be nice, or perhaps something science fiction.. Do you have any favorite actors/actresses I should look for?. Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Christian Bale, Kurt Russell, I'm not super picky though.. Have you seen Hostiles with Christian Bale?. I have, that one was pretty disappointing. Pretty boring if you ask me, which is a shame because the casting wasn't bad. Could you recommend something else?. Never Grow Old is a newer western movie with one of my favorite actors, John Cusack.

Hey there! I hear you're interested in movies. May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy?. Absolutely! I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview. Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore?. I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field. 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?. I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol. Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?. I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!!. That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!. I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat!. For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested!. I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-). Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films!. I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much!. It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure!. I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?. I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?. Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like?. Ah! Excellent. You'll be well prepared for your podcast up and coming ;) I also highly recommend Gothika. Halle Berry plays the main role, and the twist at the end is just absolutely stunning if you ask me. Definitely one of my personal favorites!. Oh interesting. Halle Berry in a suspense film that has to do with ghosts??!! Sign me up! It was awesome talking to you! Thank you so much! I will be very well prepared:). ", ". Hello how are you?

Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend.", "Interested. I do love dark movies and dark humor as well. Would you mind being more specific in terms of how they portray societies role? In other words, whom do they take stabs at? LOL", "It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it.

My fear with that movie was that it would turn out like Suicide Squad which had great potential but fell far short from expectations.

Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real.", "EXCELLENT!! you had me sold when you said Suicide squad was garbage! I accept your recommendation.

I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol.", "I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really.

What movies have you watched recently and enjoyed?. I RECENTLY HAVE WATCHED AFTER, TO ALL THE BOYS PS. I STILL LOVE YOU. BOTH WERE REALLY ENJOYABLE! I LOVED THERE STORY LINES. Both are fantastic movies! If you enjoy dramas, I suggest checking out Parasite. It just won an Academy Award for Best Picture, and has very strong reviews.. WHAT IS THE STORY LINE?. The Kim familyfather Ki-taek, mother Chung-sook, daughter Ki-jung and son Ki-woolive in a small semi-basement apartment (banjiha), have low-paying temporary jobs as pizza box folders, and struggle to make ends meet. One day, Min-hyuk, a friend of Ki-woo's and a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to promise wealth to whoever possesses it.. ooo that sounds intresting i think i might really like that! i know how it feels to struggle to make ends meet..

Parasite. I really like dramas that are suspenseful.. I watched that one. It won a few Grammy Awards.. Um, I think you mean Oscars since Grammys are for music. At least I think that's correct. Do you have any recommendations for me?. Did you see the movie Us? It came out in 2019. Yes I meant Oscars.. I did see Us - loved it! That director, who's name I forget, also directed Get Out a couple of years ago. Another fantastic film.. I see you like suspense, I can recommend the movie Midsommar. It was colorful but also scary.. Oh, I haven't seen that one. I'll check it out - thank you!. Do you like Sci-fi movies?. Yes, I do.. I'd recommend you watch a trailer for Midsommar.. I accept your recommendation. Thank you.. If you like Sci-fi movies with lots of suspense and drama, I would also recommend Snowpiercer. Like Parasite, it is also a Korean director.. I've discovered I like Korean movies. I've seen Snowpiercer and also Last Train to Busan which is a zombie movie.. Do you like classic/older movies? Or more modern films?. I do like the classics but prefer newer films.. I find newer films to be easier to watch although I do like classics too. I watch more newer films.. Me too. I'm looking forward to seeing more movies this summer.. Same here. I still think Midsommar is a good choice right now.. I'll have to check it out.. ", ". helo.

I really liked the story and the music in the first one. And of course, Olaf. I hope they have that character again from the outpost that was hilarious.. yes it's a one of a kind movie and it's best to watch with family. I definitely accept that Frozen 2 recommendation.

It depends on how I'm feeling in the moment but I usually go for more light hearted films that are easy to digest..

The Informant and Promised Land. Both are excellent. Both based on true stories.. whats the informant about?. It's about a guy that work for an agriculture corp Archer Daniels Midland.

What kind of movies do you enjoy the most?. Movies with an inspiring storyline and main character.. Those do seem to be the best kinds of movies. What is the last movie you watched that made you experince those attributes?. The Martian was great. ", ". Hey there! I hear you're interested in movies. May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy?. Absolutely! I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview. Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore?. I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field. 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?. I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol. Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?. I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!!. That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!. I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat!. For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested!. I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-). Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films!. I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much!. It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure!. I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?. ", ". "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["I've seen that one, definitely a good movie.

I'm doing well. I was wondering if you had any movie recommendations.. Let me see. Well, what kind of movies do you usually find yourself watching? What do you like?. I tend to like action movies that also involve comedy.. Oh, me too. So, what did you see last that you liked?. I really liked Avengers: Endgame because I liked the pacing and the effects were great.. Okay, I think I kind of understand your taste a little. It's sort of similar to mine, although I haven't seen an action hero movie in a while. Did you like Guardians of the Galaxy?. No, I haven't, but I heard good things about it.. Oh, I was assuming that you'd seen it. I saw that with my son and I was surprised at how much I liked it.. Were you able to see the sequel for it?. No, but I would like to. I would really recommend that. I don't know if you know who Chris Pratt is, but he's a keeper. He was on Parks & Rec, the comedy show.. I love Chris Pratt! I accept your recommendation. Thank you so much.. :) oh, I'm so happy. Cool. I hope you like it.. Do you have any other recommendations for action movies?. Hmmm...I don't know if I can think of any others that are funny like that. I know there are some though.. Oh, I just remembered. I really liked Deadpool because it did a great job of mashing comedy and action together.. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you pick a movie trailer.. Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind?. Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from.. I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up.. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary.. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?. This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright.. I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different?. It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was Ready or Not which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best!. Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend?. I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy.. Thank you so much!. ", ". Hi! I'm hoping to help recommend a movie to you.. Hi, wonderful. I like dramas, documentaries, and action films.. What is your favorite film?. The Ref. What do you like about that movie?. It's a dark comedy about a family on the verge of falling apart.. Have you heard of The Royal Tenenbaums? That is also a dark comedy about a dysfunctional family.. Yes I have.. Did you like it? Would you enjoy a similar film?. I like this recommendation. Yes, I would enjoy a similar film.. You might like The Meyerowitz Stories, about An estranged family gathers together in New York City for an event celebrating the artistic work of their father.. Perfect. I like the Meyerowitz Stories.. Glad you want to watch!. Are there more movies like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Meyerowitz Stories you recommend?.

I've seen advertisements for that one, but forgot all about it. Is it available for streaming yet I wonder? I love Seth Rogan in everything he does! Pineapple Express was great!. It is! It is streaming on Amazon Prime Video. It has so much of the classic Seth Rogan humor in it and adds a light hearted take on the whole North Korean situation. It is definitely a watch over and over again movie. I've seen it four times!. This is a perfect recommendation. I'm going to put it on right now! Thank you so much for a great movie recommendation!. No Problem! I hope you enjoy!. Thanks! I am excited to see how it is. I like James Franco a lot, too. But I've only seen him in more serious roles.. I was the same way, but I feel like after this movie he should really move into more comedic roles. He was outstanding. But you could truly see the friendship that him and Seth have on and off the camera. They played off of each other very well. That's awesome to hear. I'm pulling it up right now.

I would like a movie that caters to a younger audience. how about that movie called Giant Little Ones?. Would this cater to teenagers? I need a movie that will cater to a teen demographic if possible. yes by Josh Wiggins. Is there any action in that movie at all?. No its a story line no violence or action. Could you recommend something that has a bit of action in it?. Hunt for the wilder People. Interesting! Is there any sexual scenes in the film?. There is no sexual scenes. Who are the actors in the film?. Sam Neil and Julian Dennison. what year was it made?. it was actually 2016 on Hulu how about you can you recommend any mafia movies?. sure, how about Gotti. never had of it who's in it. amazing actor, Jon Travolta. Question about the movie you recommended...What would be the best demographic for that film?. that movie was acted in canada during winter beautiful snow mountains. oh interesting. But what age group would you say would be good to see that movie?. This movie is for 16 and up. That sounds great! Can you give me a brief summary of the story line?. Ricky Baker (Dennison), a juvenile delinquent who was abandoned by his mother, is taken by child welfare services officer Paula and police officer Andy, to live in a remote farm with foster mother Bella and her husband, the cantankerous southern man Hec (Neill).

If you are looking to check out Gotti, here is a brief summary of the movie: The film will reveal the relationship of a father who lived and died by the mob code and a son who, while brought up to lead a life of crime, chose to leave that world behind and redeem himself and the Gotti name.. Sounds like a book I read a while ago very interesting i will check it out. Awesome! And I will certainly check out your recommendation too. I have kids who would find that movie entertaining! Thank you for your recommendation!. of-course not a problem only thing I found out is that its only available on Hulu. I have Hulu so it wont be an issue looking it up. Thanks again..

No i haven't, i think i saw the trailer on Netflix! is it good?. it is very good but very long 3 hrs. 3 hours is a long time. i see Robert De Niro is in it. He is another amazing actor. Ill have to check that out as well. they made Robert De Niro and Al Pacino look really young in the movie and they age as the movie continues let me not tell you to much and kill your buzz for the movie. right right!

Hows your weekend?. It's been great. I live in Florida so the weather has been wonderful. I did stay in though last night and rewatched Elf, though. It's a classic!. I was in Destin last weekend. It was nice. I have heard about the Elf movie, however I didn't get a chance to watch so far.. What was the last movie you saw?. I watched Lion King today. I watched earlier. Again I watched with my 4 year old daughter today.. Is it the newest release? or the animated version from 1994?. Its the latest release.. Oh, what did you think of it overall? I saw it in theaters this summer.. The animation is really awesome. I enjoyed very much. What type of movies do you like?. I like all movies! My taste ranges from indie drama films all the way to movies appropriate for children such as yours.. Your taste is somewhat similar like me. However Action & Thriller movies are my favorite.. Have you ever seen any of the John Wick movies?. I watched the 1 & 2. I have to watch the 3rd.. What did you like about the movies, or anything you didn't like? Sometimes action movies get monotonous with the plot. Are you wanting to watch the 3rd or do you feel more apathetic about it?. I will watch the 3 for sure. I like the movies with nice screenplay. I don't like the movies with the expected ending or boring screenplay.. Are you a Tom Hardy fan?. I am a big fan. Who is your favorite?. Tom Hardy, Ryan Gosling, and Jake Gyllenhall in more independent films,actually. He has some films not many people are familiar with. Have you heard of the movie Drive or Nightcrawler?. I haven't watched both of them. I have heard about Nightcrawler. I will try to watch.. Tom Hardy is great and has some amazing action/thriller films he is in as well.. He is great. His voice is more unique.. He starred in Locke, and the film is just him in a car the entire time; it's actually brilliant.. Really I am going to watch tonight.. Wonderful! I also sent a recommendation for Mad Max: Fury Road. Mad Max I watched in first week. Actually I watched twice. its a masterpiece. Thanks. Have a wonderful rest of the day.. ", ". Hello! Are you interested in watching a movie trailer?. Hi! Yes I am! which movie?. I can help you find a trailer for a movie you might be interested in watching. What kind of movies do you like?. I really like action movies and movies with great acting.. Action movies are always exciting, especially when the actors are good too. What was the last action movie you saw?. the last real action movie I saw was Avengers: End Game. It was awesome. something like that would be cool. Avengers: End Game was a great movie, definitely one of my favorites from the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Let me see if I can find something similar that you will enjoy.. okay, go for it!. Are you a fan of the John Wick movies? John Wick Chapter 3- Parabellum came out this year and had great reviews (90% on Rotten Tomatoes!). ohhh yeah, i saw only the firs one, but would love to catch up with the series. I have seen all 3 and would definitely recommend finishing the series! Keanu Reeves is a brilliant actor. If you're looking to catch up, would you like to watch the trailer for John Wick Chapter 2?.

Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho.. Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation?. I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals.

I'm looking for something exciting, maybe scary. I just got done watching Nolan's Batman triology, and man i'm hooked!. I love that trilogy. The best of all the Batman's for sure. Although I grew up with the 1989 Batman's.. I'm a big fan of the genre as a whole. However, those are the best Batman's. I wonder how Robert Pattinson is going to do as the new batman. I'm not sure how I feel about it. Me either, but saw some sneak images of the suit and the Batmobile. No cape, bold choice.. Agreed. It's more of a futuristic Batman beyond type batman. What did you think of Ben in the latest installment?. I liked him more than I thought I would, but thought the movies weren't as good as they should have been. I think I have a recommendation for a trailer, have you seen The New Mutants trailer?. I felt the same exact way, you're speaking my language with the Bat. No I have not!

I would like to help you with any movie trailer recommendations!. awesome. any ideas. I have a few. What type of movies have you watched in the last couple months?. jojo rabbit, knives out, shadow. I would first recommend Gemini Man with Will Smith. Awesome movie with plenty of action but also some plot twists that lead to an interesting plot.. I have not seen that movie yet. I've thought of watching it maybe. It highly recommend it. Smith rarely disappoints. Another one would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood if you like Tarantino movies or Ford vs Ferrari for a combination historical/suspense movie.. I will definitely watch it soon then. Tarantino's movies are the best. Excellent. Enjoy! Good chatting with you.. good bye. I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view. I will try to view them. buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot. They occasionally do. From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover. There are enough other twists hidden in the movie.. my favorite movie of will smith is Men in black. but he also does serious movies also.. This will in line with his normal level of acting. Throwing in suttle humor while not losing the mood of the scene.. I'm just glad he is still in movies. I agree. It's fun to see long time actors also evolve into other roles. Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of BelAir to his movie roles now are night and day but it is still authentically him.. I forgot Gemini Man was himself against himself from the trailer. after rewatching it. Yep, pretty interesting premise.. sort of like predestination, but not time travel i assume.

I recently watched Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse and really enjoyed it!. Oh, nice! What was your favorite thing about the movie?. Honestly, I think it was just how stylish everything was. You could really tell a lot of love was put into it.. That's a great observation. Have you seen the Star Wars movies?. Many years ago, yes! I saw the original six growing up, but the new ones didn't interest me too much. And are you a fan of the rest of the Marvel Universe?. I'm not really sure. I haven't watched a lot of the MCU movies.. Well, there are so many movies out there, it's hard to make time for all of them.. That makes sense. I did enjoy the ones I did watch, such as the newest Thor and Doctor Strange.. I haven't seen all of them either, but I also have enjoyed the ones I've watched. Many of the movies have a dramatic appeal-- is that something you enjoy?. Oh yes! I love a good drama or thriller!. Ooh, thrillers! I have to admit I am more the type to read the description on Wikipedia! Do you like being on the edge of your seat in a movie, or do you like everything to work out in the end?. Edge of my seat, if possible.. Okay! I personally enjoy movies with great cinematography, what about you?. Absolutely! Thats what I love about a lot of Edgar Wright's movies.. Have you seen The Black Panther? If not, I would recommend it!. I have! And I agree, thats a really good recommendation!. I have also heard that Ant Man is a popular one..

I like many movie genres, like romance, comedies, suspense, and thrillers.. I was really impressed with Joker, The Irishman, or for something a little lighter I recommend Toy Story 4.. I've been wanting to see the Joker but haven't yet.. It is a really interesting movie and Joaquin Phoenix rendition of the Joker is very captivating..

There are two well known actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth. Looks like they play really good roles in this movie.. Sounds great. I will accept this recommendation!.

Absolutely, thank you for paying attention to my details and picking a movie that seems fit!. Interesting fact, this movie also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture for Drama.. Thats great! Movies that have awards or have higher ratings are always give more of an incentive to watch.. I agree, it is also more interesting if it is based on a true story. Shows the struggles that this generation could never image.. That is why I love that genre as well! To see and watch something that has actually happened that at the same time seems so unreal! Mind blowing!. Yes, the base of the movie is about two British privates that were given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory, these days they would just use phone or email..

That's lovely to hear may i make a suggestion? to you i used to love watching it as a kid every December with my family.. I'd love to hear any suggestions you might have. Watching movies together was always a holiday tradition for us as well.. rudolph the red nosed reindeer original claymation film. was a family favorite of ours and the original animate Grinch was my favorite as a kid. i feel it has alot built in to the 2 films with american Christmas culture. Those are two of my favorites for sure. But I'm looking for something a little different. Not a cartoon. And nothing too cheesy. Something that's more comedy than drama.. oooh i have a good suggesting what about elf staring Will Ferrel its about Buddy (Will Ferrell) was accidentally transported to the North Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa's elves.. That sounds perfect! I accept the recommendation. Thank you.. is their any more recommendations you are looking for ?. No I think that sounds perfect.. ok have have a lovely night and happy holiday. You too. Thanks again for the recommendation.. i do appoligize for my late delays in replies my typing is a little slow. That's quite alright.

Do you prefer the older Stephen King's It, or would you prefer the new Stephen King's IT. The new Stephen King's IT.

Its called Black Christmas, have you heard about it yet?. I have heard about Black Christmas. Why do you think I would like it?. I think you would like it because it takes Christmas to a whole new level and brings a bit of horror with it. Its about a group of students that are stalked by a person during their christmas break.. Sounds like a very good movie for the occasion since my Christmas break is coming up soon. I like watching movies or shows during certain seasons. I think this movie will be a great option over Christmas. I accept your recommendation.. Yeah I'm the same when it comes to watching movies or shows during a certain season.

They both play important roles to me. A boring concept with great acting can make a decent film as much as a very unique plot with mediocre acting.

For horror, I would recommend the movie The Witch starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Hereditary starring Toni Collette.. I haven't heard of that one, so I will give it a shot!. For sci-fi, Ex Machina starring Oscar Isaac(Poe from Star Wars) is probably one of the best in recent years. I have been considering watching that one for a while, I'll have to give it a shot if you are recommending it.. Great movie about robot singularity. What are your favorite fantasy movies?. I have a wide taste when it comes to fantasy: Willow, the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Clash of the Titans, Lady Hawk, Highlander, Sleepy Hollow, all of the Lord of the Rings movies and spin offs of course.. Not to familiar with fantasy, but I absolutely loved Pan's Labyrinth. I'll jot down those movies to watch soon.. Pan's Labyrinth was pretty awesome!.

I am looking for any action or scary movie to watch. Any suggestions?. I'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe myself. There are a few good ones out there. Let's see if I can narrow it down a bit. Are there any actors that you particularly enjoy? And what style scary movie do you prefer? More along the lines of horror/slasher or tense thriller or something else?. I am a big fan too, so I've seen all of them! I might be leaning more towards a scary movie. Last kind of scary movie I saw was Us. So I am more interested in a tense thriller. I don't like much the typical non sense slasher movie.. Perfect. And are you looking for something that is in theaters now or a movie to watch at home?. I am looking for something to watch at home.. Okay. I have a few things in mind. One of my favorite thrillers is Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Sigourney Weaver stars as an agoraphobic forensic psychologist who studies serial killers and Holly Hunter is a detective looking for a killer who is copying some of the most famous serial killers of all time murder.

I do, I am also a big James Bond fan, so I am excited to see the new one.. I haven't seen the trailer for that one yet. Is it still daniel craig?. Yes it is. The trailers are really good, but it does help to be a fan and know about the last few movies. Make sure you catch it.. I think the only Daniel Craig James Bond that I've seen was casino royale. There was an older one I saw a very long time ago with a ski lodge? but the memory is very fuzzy. Which Daniel Craig Bond films should I see before I watch the latest one?. Well, I would suggest at least the last one, which is Spectre. What other type of movies do you enjoy?. A pretty wide variety if I'm being honest. I tend to lean towards action films; like Pacific Rim and Mad Max: Fury Road. Honestly if a movie involves a pretty woman controlling a big machine, I'll probably love it. Do you have any recommendations?. Haha. I tend to go that way too. I am also a huge Star wars fan. You'll definitely enjoy the new James Bond, action and story.. Okay, I accept your recommendation. Thank you!. Enjoy, and I'm sure you'll check out the new Black Widow movie.. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Marvel. I think I'm a bit burned out. I did like the most recent Thor movie though. It was a refreshing change of pace.. Yeah, they do wear you out.. did you see the trailer for promising young woman?. No I haven't seen that one yet.. It's a female revenge fantasy.

Hi, so I hear your interested in movies. Yes, I am interested in movies.. What kind of movies do you like?. Action, Sci-Fi, Abstract, all kinds of different movies. Even some kids movies! Do you have any recommendations?. Yes, do you think you would like the irishman?. What is that about?. Its about the mafias involvement with the teamsters labor movement and politicians in Washington. Yes, that sounds like a movie I can get into. Do you have any others?. Hobbs & Shaw which is an action movie. The reason I asked is because I like to have options and choose from my options. I actually have heard good things about Hobbs & Shaw. I accept Hobbs & Shaw... Do you think you would like Fast & Furious 6, just like Hobbs and Shaw.. I'm sure I would. I'll have to check them both out and even the whole franchise. I would like something out of the box though. Do you have any good abstract, whoa movies, such as Intersteller?. indeed I do, would you like to see the trailer?. Yes, I would like to see the trailer.. ", ". How are you today?. hi, how are you? I love to hear about movies.. Have you seen any trailers for movies coming out soon? If so, which ones are you interested in seeing?. I have seen a trailer for the new movie that came out on February 14th. It was Sonic the Hedgehog.. Was the movie any good? The trailer made it look amusing.. It looked good and I am interesting in seeing this movie.. Have you seen the trailer for the new James Bond movie? I always see the newest Bond films.. I have not yet, but I am willing to consider seeing the James Bond film.. From what I see, it looks like a logical continuation of the Spectre theme - it has the Bond girl form the last file as well as the newest Blofield. I think this will be great.. hmmm that sounds good. that reminds me of the older james bond movie with sean connery- diamonds are forever. if you got the trailer, i would be willing to watch it.. Diamonds are forever was a classic. I do, however, like the newer films more. Less cynicism and more plausible. What do you think?. I agree. sometimes the remakes are just as good as the orginials.. I am looking at the trailer for Casino Royale - a great reboot is ever there was one.. great movie. i liked daniel craig playing poker in that movie.. Yes - the Texas Hold'em scene was suspensful.. agreed. and intense. anyway i do accept your recommendation for the new james bond film.. Great! Let's watch that trailer.. sounds good to me.. ", ". Hello, how are you? I went to the movie theater last night and saw Knives Out, it was awesome! Have you seen it yet, or been to the movies lately? I absolutely see why Knives Out was rated at around 97% rotten tomatoes.. Hello, I am well thanks for asking. How are you? I can't say I have seen that movie or even heard of it. I am interested in a romance is there anything that you would recommend?. Have you seen To all the boys i still love you on netflix? Part 1 came out last year, and part 2 was recently released! It plays off the narrative of the first one and has some very interesting romances/flings/secret relationships... Plus it has some heart warming comedy. Do you like any other movie types?. No, I haven't see that movie. What is it about? Who play in that movie? I love all kind of movies but more interested in a romance at the moment.. the first one is actually called To all the boys I've loved before and the second is called To all the boys p.s. I still love you. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes. Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy! The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time. She has to choose one of them though, who will it be?. OH WOW! I know she was like OMG. I am curious on how the letters got out. I glad that never happened to me. I am also curious on who will it be as well.. You should watch the movie so you can find out. It stars a handful of Netflix's new age of top actors and actresses like Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, and Janel Parrish.. Okay awesome I will watch it thank you. Great, so would you like to watch the trailer first?. Yes, do you have the link?. It's on netflix and youtube. Okay. thanks going to watch it now :). where you able to find it?. Okay, I will add this to the list. Do you recommend anything else?.

Romantic Comedy is a good genre. The wife and I watch those together often.. is there a particular actor you like?. Not necessarily. I'm open to any actors as long as they are decent. DeCaprio, Hanks, Smith..Pitt, any of them are always pretty watchable.. What was the last action movie you saw?. I just finished watching World War Z with Brad Pitt, although I've seen it a few dozen times! The last action movie would probably have been Skyscraper with The Rock. They were both great movies. mine was frozen 2 haha. Ahh, you probably have little ones. My daughter was into the original frozen, but has NO interest in Frozen 2..she's WAY too cool for it, lol.. nope my kids are now older but it was enjoyable. I may have to watch it..I'll probably end up watching it eventually, no way to avoid all these disney movies, lol. exactly! Do you enjoy going to the movies and seeing new releases or on TV (a home). I usually watch releases at home, but I do like to go to the fancy Dolby Theater for big releases, like Avengers.. Nice. comfort is always the best especially for an action movie. Yes, I agree!

It just won an Academy Award for Best Picture, and has very strong reviews.. WHAT IS THE STORY LINE?. The Kim familyfather Ki-taek, mother Chung-sook, daughter Ki-jung and son Ki-woolive in a small semi-basement apartment (banjiha), have low-paying temporary jobs as pizza box folders, and struggle to make ends meet. One day, Min-hyuk, a friend of Ki-woo's and a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to promise wealth to whoever possesses it.. ooo that sounds intresting i think i might really like that! i know how it feels to struggle to make ends meet..

No, I haven't see that movie. What is it about? Who play in that movie? I love all kind of movies but more interested in a romance at the moment.. the first one is actually called To all the boys I've loved before and the second is called To all the boys p.s. I still love you. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes. Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy! The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time. She has to choose one of them though, who will it be?. OH WOW! I know she was like OMG. I am curious on how the letters got out. I glad that never happened to me. I am also curious on who will it be as well.. ", ". ", ". Hello. Are you interested in any trailers?. Hi! Yes. I'm looking for a movie to go to with my family this week. What do you recommend?.

I don't like much the typical non sense slasher movie.. Perfect. And are you looking for something that is in theaters now or a movie to watch at home?. I am looking for something to watch at home.. Okay. I have a few things in mind. One of my favorite thrillers is Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter.

It was wonderful. Disney movies are always great no matter how old you are. Would you like to watch the movie trailer live action - Lady and the Tramp.

Oh my goodness, that sounds like a really fun time! I really liked the first one, I haven't gotten around to seeing the second one yet! Was there anything you disliked?. I can't recall any parts that i disliked actually. You should check it out especially if you have small children.. How rare is that! I'll definitely have to check it out then!

Based off of three women who have husbands in Irish mafia. Such a great film also. Do you know of any other movies similar to that?. That sounds really good! If you like movies about women and crime, you might like Widows! It's set in contemporary Chicago. Four women are left with their husband's massive debt after they all mysteriously die from criminal activities. They have to take matters into their own hands and do things on their own terms!

I'll check that one out too!. I know, right? It also has KeKe Palmer and Julia Stiles as well. But based upon your interest in The Kitchen, I think Widows might be the most similar!

What's the last movie in each of those types that you've watched?. Recently, I have watched twilight. I also watched Step Brothers, The Grinch, and The Hangover.. So it seems that you've been into comedies recently, would you like to see a trailer for another one or something a little different?. Something a little different.. Something a little more in the romance/drama realm?. That Sounds Great!. I think you'd really like A Star is Born. Came out to great reviews from audiences and critics alike, and, its got great music with the drama/romantics that you are looking for!. What is the movie about?. It stars Bradley Cooper, an old musician, who helps a younger musician, Lady Gaga, rise to stardom while his age and struggles with alcohol sees his career take a turn for the worse.. When was it released?. Came out just last year, in October of 2018. What is the movie rated?. Its rated R for language throughout, some sexuality/nudity and substance abuse. Are there any other big stars besides Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in the movie?. It also has Sam Elliot, Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chapelle, and Anthony Ramos. This movie sounds great! I think I will definitely give it a try! Do you have any other good movie recommendations for me?. ", ". Hello. How are you?. Hello! I am good- yourself?. Good.

Have you seen any movies lately?. Yes There I did saw a movie last night, what about you?. I love movies. In fact, I'm here to help you look for a trailer. What did you watch last night?. I actually saw Top Gun, have you heard of it?. Of course! I only watched it a million times in the theater. Did you like it?. It was saw great, i loved it. Me too. Why did you like it? The action? The actors?. The action, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him.. I haven't seen it in a long time, but I do watch little bits and pieces if it's on TV. Funny that they're making a sequel 35 years later.. Yes, but whats your favorite Trailer for the year. Trailer? Probably James Bond, No Time to Die. Or Top Gun 2. Lol.. Awesome i thing i prefer the Top Gun2.

Hello, what genre of movies do you enjoy?. Hi, nice to meet you. nice to meet you too!. I love dramas. What is a good drama movie you have watched reccently?. Let me think on that a minute. Ok, no problem!. My mind is a blank right now. But I love good acting, that's very important. A good drama you may be interested in is Taxi Driver, the film tells the story of a lonely taxi driver, who descends into insanity. Is that the one with Robert Deniro?. Yes it is!-. Yes, I've seen that one. It's very good. I think he won an award for that one. Do you have any newer recommendations?. A movie with a similar concept is The Joker 2019. Oh yea, I've been wanting to see that one. Do you know is it still at the theater?. Not sure, but it was really good.. You saw it?. ", ". Hey, how are you doing? I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Great! Do you know of any romantic comedies?. Yes, the Long Shot with Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron came out earlier this year and was great!. I never heard of that one but I like Charlize Theron, she is usually in good movies. Can you tell me a little about it?. The two leads are opposites, but are brought together by their careers. They bond when they realize that Charlize Theron's cahracter was Seth Rogan's character's baby sitter. Seth Rogan is in his typical stoner role, but it doesn't come off contrived. Charlize Theron plays a sophisticated diplomat.. Oh that sounds good, I think I will watch it. Thanks for the good recommendation!. Thank you. I think you'll enjoy the movie a lot! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Yes, I would!. Got it! I will get you the movie trailer.. Thank you!. Okay, I have selected Long Shot as your trailer. Enjoy!. Thanks! I just watched it and it looks like a great movie. I will be watching it soon for sure! Do you like these kinds of movies as well?. Great! I knew you would like it, it's a good romcom and the actors are hilarious. I like to watch romcoms every once in awhile. They can be predictable, but always funny.. How about drama's, can you recommend a good drama?. The recent Joker movie that came out has great critical acclaim and is an intense drama.. Is it scary at all? I don't really like scary movies!. ", ". hello! my names Paul how are you?. I'm good, how are you Paul?. Doing well, So seeing as you're looking for a movie, Action, Comedy or thriller?. More of a thriller type. Oh great! I love thrillers. halloween is an all time classic but I'm more into the conjuring type movies. Same here, but I am more of a Kevin Bacon fan.. So then im guessing you've recently seen The Darkness. I have not!. That one you definitely have to see. It's one of his newer movies, 2016 to be exact but its very well made and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I will have to look into that for sure.. Do you want to see the Trailer?. Sure thing!. Okay cool. How long is the trailer?.

Yes I do like scary movies with aliens.. That's awesome, I really enjoy those too. Movies about time travel are good to.. So which do you like better? Time travel or aliens?. Aliens.

I hope I can find a movie you would really like to see.. What movie do you recommend?. I have some good recommendations but I was wondering what genre you like enjoy the most?. I like thrillers and comedy mostly, and things with a good cinematography, though i Gotta be in the mood for it. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch!. Great, I love movies. Anything you can recommend? I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently.. Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it?. Yes, I have seen it. Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. So was Anne Hathaway.. I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day. But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new! What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it?. I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk. Reminds me of my childhood.. Ah, the Avengers movies are so good! I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman. Have you seen that movie?. No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire.. I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!. Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?. He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies!. I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good.. Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think?. Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron. Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow? I enjoyed that character from The Avengers. I did! Doesn't Scarlette Johanson star as Black Widow? I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Black Widow! She appears in the subsequent Avenger's movies as well, so you should enjoy her in those.. Yes, Scarlett Johansson. I remember seeing her in a movie called The Horse Whisperer, it was a sad movie. But Scarlett Johansson gave a nice performance. It may have been one of her 1st movies.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["It is called After Earth", "Have you seen the movie Hustlers yet?

Of course, as with most movies, there is a conflict for the agent and he has to do whatever it takes to protect the president. There is a LOT of action that I think you would like.

I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview. Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore?. I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field. 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?. I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol. Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?. I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!!. That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!. I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat!. For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested!. I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-). Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films!. I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much!. It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure!. I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?. I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires?. Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like?. Ah! Excellent. You'll be well prepared for your podcast up and coming ;) I also highly recommend Gothika. Halle Berry plays the main role, and the twist at the end is just absolutely stunning if you ask me. Definitely one of my personal favorites!. Oh interesting. Halle Berry in a suspense film that has to do with ghosts??!! Sign me up! It was awesome talking to you! Thank you so much! I will be very well prepared:). ", ". Hello! Have you seen any awesome movies lately?. Yes I have. I've seen 1917 and Joker.. Nice, Joker is a wonderful movie, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. I have not seen 1917, what is it about?. It is about World War I and two British soldiers going behind enemy lines to save over a thousand of their fellow soldiers.It was very suspenseful.. Sounds interesting, I definitely have to check it out. If you enjoy movies about war I highly recommend Dunkirk.. I have hard of Dunkirk but haven't seen that one. I like such movies that are based on history and full of suspense and have surprise endings. I will have to check that one out.. You'll love Dunkirk, it is about the Allied evacuation of France during World War 2. It's a drama, but there is plenty of action. Have you seen Saving Private Ryan?. Yes I have seen Saving Private Ryan some years ago. It was one of my favorites, well acted with a great plot and plenty of action.. Definitely agree, also the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are easily some of the best in cinema history. Steven Spielberg is a genius. Do you enjoy super hero movies?. No, Super Hero Movies not as much, I do like the Batman franchise though. I will definitely take your recommendation for Dunkirk.. I'm glad to hear it. If you don't mind me asking, what are your dislikes about super hero franchises?. I find Super Hero movies too predictable and repetitious of previous super hero movies.. Ah alright, and out of the Batman franchise, what are your likes?. Dark Knight, Justice League, Joker. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Happy you are okay with the choice", "No problem!

What types of movies do you like to watch?. Hello! I'm more of an action movie or a good romance and mystery movie.. I just saw the trailer for Knives Out when I went to see Joker and it looked like a good mix of action and mystery!. I seen that one too as I seen Joker about a month ago. I thought about asking my fiance about going and seeing it.. It looks like a good movie for people who like many different movies. It also has a great cast! I was surprised to see Chris Evans in the trailer!. Maybe with Chris Evans in it it'll be easier to convince my fiance to see it. Do you know who else is in the cast?. Daniel Craig and Jamie Lee Curtis are also in the cast. Daniel Craig does a lot of 007 so definitely a good hearthrob role to convince the misses lol!. I am the misses lol. But he loves the bond movies so that should be a good incentive for him to go see it. Do you have any other recommendations?. The new Star Wars comes out in less than a month, if you are into the franchise.. He is, I think he told me we're getting it when it comes out to add to our movie collection.. Well that is another great action movie. I also recommend the John Wick series. I haven't seen any of that series. Could you tell me what the general plot is>. John Wick is a former member of a gang, he was basically an assassin. He falls in love and quits the game, but then his wife dies, and someone comes in and kills his dog. He then goes on a revenge rampage against the people who broke into his house. I have yet to watch the 3rd one but the action scenes were really cool!. Oh I'd definitely would cry at the dogs death.. It is really sad! the dog was a last gift from his dying wife which makes it so much worse. I couldn't even finish I am legend because of the dog dying. Anything with animal death makes me ball like a baby.. Marley & Me had me crying for a good half hour so I completely understand that!. I avoided that movie because someone told me he passed away. My fiance took me to see jurrasic world as our first date and I cried at the dinosuars dying.. I would definitely avoid that movie if animal deaths make you said. Oh that is so cute though!. Yeah, he had to calm me down for about an hour and bought me ice cream to apologize for it.. ", ". Hello! Can I help you find a movie?. Please! I'm a huge fan of horror films, but prefer more dread than gore. Do you have any suggestions?. What is your favorite horror film?. My favorite horror film would probably be The Shining. It's a unique story that keeps the viewer on edge the entire time. I love that over jump scares and senseless gore.. Ok, awesome. Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer?. Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already.. It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best.. Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as Hitchcock-ian?. I will do my best to find something you haven't seen!. Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film!. How did you feel about Split from M. Night? Did you find it too slow, or did that have the dread you're looking for?. I actually haven't seen that one yet. I also did not know Night made that one. Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about?. It's one of my favorites he's done so far. James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film.. 23 personalities! That sounds interesting. Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film? He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a bad guy before.. ", ". Hey, how are you?. Hi I'm good. You>.

I saw it a few years ago back when it first came out and watch it every December. I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect.. If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies .. Oh hands down! I believe it's on Amazon Prime now, but I still watch on the original DVD like a movie nerd lol. Enjoy!. I prefer original DVD's rather than streaming or downloadable mediums.. Same!

But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?. I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though.. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?. That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres?. I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?. I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy.. Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!. I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it.. Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!. That does sound pretty perfect!. I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy.. I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha!. Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself..

Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it.. Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie?. The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it. Its moving and touching in all the right ways!. Well that sounds like a dream. Can you tell me a little about the plot? I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself.. Of course! I suppose using today's standards, it would be considered a dramedy (drama comedy) and is traces the life of Midler's character who teamed up with Caan's character, Eddie Sparks, who was a famous entertainer. He thinks he needs something to help bolster his act so he enlists the help of Dixie Leonard, Midler's character. They primarily get together to train US Troops during the war.. Wait a minute. They're entertainers but they train the military?. Oh gosh. I'm sorry, not train, entertain....my goodness. Please forgive my mind!. HAHA! It's totally okay. I was like What qualifies showman to train the military?! Haha! So Bette Midler has some singing in it?. ", ". Hello! How're you today?. I'm doing fantastic!. Great!

Hi I'm looking for someone who is looking for a recommendation for a movie. Sure what kind of movies are you interested in?. I like movies that are feel good types - how about you?.

Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. I am looking for a movie recommendation. I have been pretty bored lately.. What Genres are you interested in?. My favorite genre is horror but I also enjoy dramas like gangster and war movies and I like comedies but not romantic ones.. Good choices!

Do you like movies that make your heart race?. I suppose I do. I like horror, some thrillers, and I like action movies but I'm picky about them. Fury Road was amazing.. Have you ever seen the shallows? This is the one about a surfer who gets caught at see and has trouble with a vicious shark? That one really got my heart pumping. I did see The Shallows. I liked it. On a similar note I saw Crawl recently which I also enjoyed.. I got the perfect movie for you, just recently came out and i went to see it in theaters this past weekend! Will really get you thinking, also hope you like plot twists!. I love twisty movies. A twist done well like The Sixth Sense or Wild Things is so much fun.. Check out this trailer for 21 bridges then!. What is it about?. It is about a criminal that is being tracked by NYPD in manhatten..chase is getting so intense that they end up closing all 21 bridges in and out of manhatten.. That sounds very interesting. Do you know any of the cast?. Yes, the main character, Chadwick Boseman. He was also the main character in Black Panther, which was a great movie as well.. He was very good in that even though I was not a big fan of the movie. I would certainly give this movie a try.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["It's about Mr. Rogers - yes, from PBS.

Yea the film has big stars in it. Basically the film is a mix of murder mystery, crime, thriller, with heavy aspects of comedy. Overall the comedy offsets the cime aspect of the film making it a fun watch. Overall the film is about a family where a murder takes place and the cast tries to solve who was murdered.

Do you have any actors or actresses that you liked in that movie. Also are there any genres that you hate?. I'm not very picky about that.

I wasn't a fan of the transformer movies. I saw the first one. I watched it as a kid way back when and the live action version is not my thing. whats your favorite movie right now maybe we can spark some ideas from there. While it is not a comedy movie, I like classic sports movies as well. The natural and field of dreams are tied for 1st.. im a big fan of invincible and the longest yard these have strong motivations that drive the plot. Those are great movies!. what about friday night lights have you seen this one. I accept that recommendation. I have not seen that movie.. cool i think you will like it. I look forward to it!. do we have to keep chatting to finish'. until we hit 10 turns yes. ok well lets inprovise. sounds good to me. good you are a great person. thank you, you too. ", ". Hi. How are you today?. I am good thank you.:). What kind of movies do you typically watch at the movie theater?. typically high adrenaline types, rambo,f&f, etc, etc. So you're a big Sylvester Stalone fan. Is that fair to say?. I wouldn't say a big fan but I do enjoy his movies the older ones were better.. I agree with you, his older movies were very well made. Who is your favorite actor now?. I don't have a favorite per say now, most movies are all the same rewashed content, same with the actors really.. I have good action film for you. How about Hobs & Shaw?. Yeah That sounds good I accept. I have another movie for you. Knives Out!!!. Hmm m that looks pretty good I am done. It has a very good plot and Daniel Craig has the lead role in this one.. I just watched the trailer on youtube it looks good with some humor as well i think i might give it a try later thanks for the recommendation. ", ". Hi! What kind of movies do you like?. Hello, I like a variety of movies, recently have been watching The Mandalorian and a lot of martial arts movies from the 70s and 80s.. Nice, so you're a fan well-choreographed combat? Any specific movies or shows besides The Mandalorian?. Drunken Master and other Jackie Chan films are up my alley. Well-choreographed fighting is intriguing to me for sure.. Drunken Master is great, he's got such a cool style of fighting. Are you into franchises or film series (if they're good), or are you more of a standalone film fan?. I'm fine with either, Star Wars has a pretty good franchise although I can't say the recent movies are great, but I can take or leave franchises compared to standalone films.. I totally get it, the franchises can often bring quality down. Have you by any chance seen John Wick?. Yes I have, got the chance to see Chapter 2 and 3 in theatres, looking forward to the next iteration.. Ok solid that's a great series. What about You Were Never Really Here?. I haven't heard about that movie, what's it about?. It's a pretty gritty action thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix, where he plays a former mercenary who deals with his trauma by taking down a human trafficking network and rescuing the girls they had captive. Would you be interested in watching the trailer?. Sounds similar to Taken, but sure, I'll give it a go.. It's better than Taken, much more intense and less by-the-numbers. Enjoy!. Thank you!.

Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot.. That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated?. For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie. Oh nice. What is that one about?. It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too.. That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one. You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best.. I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids. ", ". Good day! I am here to interest you in some movie trailers :). Hey, how's it going? Sounds like someone tattled on me. XD Yeah, I was actually hoping to find something to watch later.. Very well thank you for asking! Are there any genres you are into? Or perhaps willing to discover new genres?. I've always been a fan of comedy stuff but I've never passed up a good cartoon either. That said, if you got an odd one on the brain, I'm open to new ideas.. Wonderful! I love to expand people's interest in movies. What movies have you watched lately that have sparked your interest in this genre?. In which genre? Recent movies I've seen include; Deadpool 2, DOOM, Kung Foo Panda, Avengers: EndGame... I'm all over the map, I know.. Comedy and animated! That is a great selection of movies under your belt there :D Based on your choices, I have managed to come up with a movie that is both comedy and animated. It is called Sausage Party featuring Seth Rogan, James Franco, and Jonah Hill!. Oh yeah! That was actually on my list of 'Things to Watch' and I guess I just forgot about it. That's the one with the Supermarket foods right? Like Toy Story but for adults?. You got it! It is very entertaining with its content, but also very pleasing for the eyes with so many colors!. Bright colors AND entertaining. This pleases me. :| I guess I know what I'm watching later. Thanks for the recommendation!. ", ". Hello! how are you? What type of movie do you like?. Hi there - I am a big fan of fantasy and horror, Stephen King, etc. Got any recommendations?. Cool! Have you seen The Shining? What about Stephen King's IT? If you are a fan of horror movies you will like these. Oh, I like the IT. I think I will accept that recommendation and check it out. Thanks so much :). Okay sounds good. We still have to talk back and forth for several more turns. So let me ask you. Have you seen the old version of It?. Oh, I did not realize. I actually did see the 1990 version (on TV). Which one do you think is better - new or old?. Well I think the new version is creepier in my opinion. But not sure the chapter II is that good.. Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot. I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it!. I definitely will check it out - are you a Stephen King fan?. Yes of course! I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie?. The Shining was solid. Obviously, the Jack Nicholson version was a classic. A favorite definitely. I also liked a little known TV film and book called Rose Red...underrated.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Yeah, me too.

I love watching zombie movies and this movie is quite different from other movies of this kind because it isn't dark.....it brings in comedy and is more fun. I like the actors too, they have great synergy with one another and makes it more enjoyable to watch. That's a creepy and definitely a good one! The actors in that one are good! I love almost all of the movies that Emma Stone plays in. A good comedy horror is nice too as long as they don't get too cheesy. Are you wanting to watch something along the same lines as Zombieland or do you want to reach for something different this round?. I could definitely go for something different this time around.

One I have enjoyed with Will Farrell is The Other Guys. Hilarious cop comedy with him and Mark Wahlberg.. Yes, I love that one! It's very funny.. It is! I assume you have already seen Step Brother as well. Have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. I actually haven't seen either of them.

That is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!. That is a classic. I saw that a long time ago. I wasn't sure what you meant by historical, but you meant movies that are more classical? I have some recommendations that are coming to mind.. I believe that it is also historical because of the time period in which the movie takes place. I do like classic movies too though. Do you like action at all? I recent movie that I saw was 1917 for example. It recently came out. That one blew me away.. I do sometimes like action but war movies where the main character dies make me mad. I am willing to hear your thoughts though.. I agree. I don't like those kind of movies where the main character dies. What about movies with a happy ending?. I like happy endings...They make me happy haha.. ", ".

I want to see a movie over the holidays and I'm curious about what you might suggest and I'm looking for a recommendation..

I like it when movies have a lot of character development.. I don't like horror either! Way too scary. What was the last movie that you watched?. The last movie I watched was Captain Marvel and I really liked it.. Yes! Great movie. Let me see what I can find that I think you will like.. Awesome. Like I said, I like action films and I typically like nerdy films like Star Wars or Marvel stuff. I like witty humor and banter rather than slap-stick type humor. I like a complex, yet understandable plot. Nothing too out there like Inception or anything.. 21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see. With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion.. Hmm, I've never heard of it. What's the gist? I'm assuming about police shooting people? I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda.. It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run.. Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction?. It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies!. Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like my type of movie. I will definitely go see it considering that plot and that actor. Thanks for your recommendation! I'll go see that movie over the holiday.. Great!

I really like the dynamic between rae and ben.. I like the scenery the best, and I also love the characters such as Luke Skywalker and Ben.

And I do love movies that are based in space and have action too.. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch!. Great, I love movies. Anything you can recommend? I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently.. Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it?. Yes, I have seen it. Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. So was Anne Hathaway.. I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day. But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new! What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it?. I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk. Reminds me of my childhood.. Ah, the Avengers movies are so good! I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman. Have you seen that movie?. No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire.. I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman!. Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?. He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies!. I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good.. Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think?. Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron. Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow? I enjoyed that character from The Avengers.

The last one I saw was the latest Purge movie and I really enjoyed that. The good was though theme was the same, there were some resistance beginning to be considered. The bad was the purge violence appeared a bit forced, but I liked it.. I saw that too! The purge are pretty good movies. Last one I saw wat It2! It was pretty good and we liked it.

May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy?. Absolutely! I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview. Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore?. I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field. 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently?. I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol. Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?. I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!!. That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list!. I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat!. For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested!. I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-). Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films!. I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much!. It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure!. I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer.. Hi! Thank you for being willing to help. I am excited to see the movie trailer.. What is the last movie you watched?. A movie called Primer. It's an independent film about two engineers that discover time travel and it ends up causing them serious problems.. Sounds cool, do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. It was great. It was sort of confusing trying to keep all the timelines straight, but I enjoyed it. I like all sorts of movies and genres. I do really enjoy time travel though (love Back to the Future and Terminator). My favorite genre is probably psychological thrillers.. Got it, I will try to find a recommendation.. I just really like movies in general. Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Horror, Sci-Fi. Oddly though, I don't really get into Comic Book movies. I didn't grow up with comics, so I think I missed out on something, but I just don't get excited about all the Marvel movies and stuff.. I don't like comic book movies either.. Mad respect for you.

I'm all over the map, I know.. Comedy and animated! That is a great selection of movies under your belt there :D Based on your choices, I have managed to come up with a movie that is both comedy and animated. It is called Sausage Party featuring Seth Rogan, James Franco, and Jonah Hill!. Oh yeah! That was actually on my list of 'Things to Watch' and I guess I just forgot about it. That's the one with the Supermarket foods right? Like Toy Story but for adults?. You got it! It is very entertaining with its content, but also very pleasing for the eyes with so many colors!. Bright colors AND entertaining. This pleases me. :| I guess I know what I'm watching later. Thanks for the recommendation!. Got it, I hope you enjoy your movie!. I'm sure I will. I meant to see it when it was still in theaters.. There is nothing like watching it in the comfort of your home though!. Right? Plus the last time I checked it was on Netflix, so basically free.. ANOTHER WIN! :D That's my favorite part of it all. I was also thinking you could watch a more family friend cartoon if you needed a more family oriented movie.. Oh the wife already has a movie planned for the next 'Family Movie'. Frozen 2. She's nuts for Elsa.. WONDERFUL watch! Beautiful movie for both kids and adults. Another beautiful cartoon is Coco, fantastic for the family!. I love Coco. It's one of those few cartoons that makes you sad even as an adult. So much passion in that movie.. That movie always gets me! I agree, that movie was definitely a tear jerker. I believe onward is another movie that has a deep family meaning behind it.. I'll have to look into that one too... For the moment though, I think Sausage Party is the go-to. Knowing I missed one on my list is going to bug me until I watch it.. Perfect! Would you like to watch this movie trailer?.

I also like everyday neighbor type movies.. Well, along the lines of the last one, there is A beautiful day in the neighborhood. Its about Mr. Rogers.. Hmmm. Who is in that one?. He had a famous childrens show for a while. But he was apparantly a really interesting person in real life. It got great reviews and stars Tom Hanks.. Oh, I usually like Tom Hanks. I remember a little bit about Mr. Rogers. Is it a comedy or more of a biography?. It is a biography. But its funny.. It sounds like something that I would enjoy. I will accept your recommendation.. Cool. But before you go...I just rewatched There's something about Mary. Its a classic comedy...if you want to stay at home.. Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?. Yes. Matt Damon and Bed Stiller too. A cameo by Brett Favre is also in there.. I don't remember Brett Favre. I think the movie was a bit crude, if I remember. That's not really my thing.. Well then by all means stick with a beautiful day in the neighborhood. You love it. Nothing crude about it.. Do you have any other ideas for being at home? I do like to have options.. You know what you might like. The Truman Show. If you like films about one's neigborhood. Its fascinating.. Oh, I almost watched that one not too long ago. That has Jim Carey?. ", ". hello :) I'm here to help you find a movie trailer, Do you know what type you would like to see?. Yes I like comedy movies. what was the last movie you watched?. I watched new dr. Dolittle movie. nice, how was it?. The movie was good. I watched with my family. :) is there any actor in particular you would like to see?. I like Jim Carrey movies. Jim Carrey IS great, what was the last movie you watched with him?. I watched Dark Crimes. haven't seen that one yet, Have you seen The Incredible Burt Wonderstone?. Yes I have seen it. would you like to see something before or after 2000?. after 2000. how about I love you Phillip Morris?. Is it good.

Thank you for the recommendation! I accept it :). Awesome!! I hope you enjoy. Thank you!. You are welcome.If that doesnt work out check out 'It chapter 2. Awesome! I saw the first one when it came out. I thought it was funnier than it was scary, but I still enjoyed it. Thanks for that recommendation too! I also accept it (but will check out Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark first, lol)!. The first one was really good. Yeah, I thought the actors did a great job!

Would you like to know more about it?. Sure, what's Booksmart about?. It's about two overachieving high school girls who decide to cram all the things they missed out on in high school into one night.. Whose it starring? This almost feels like a Melissa McCarthy role.. It's got Lisa Kudrow from friends! No Melissa McCarthy though, surprisingly.. Ooh, I like Lisa Kudrow. Haven't seen in her a movie yet.. Me neither! I think I need to watch this movie ASAP.

SciFi, Action, Fantasy, Horror. For horror, do you enjoy scares or a more suspenseful ride throughout the film?. Suspenseful rides are better.. Are you a fan of The Others or Silence of the Lambs?. I haven't seen The Others, but yes I love Silence of the Lambs.. ", ". Hi! What kind of movies do you like?. Hello, I like a variety of movies, recently have been watching The Mandalorian and a lot of martial arts movies from the 70s and 80s.. Nice, so you're a fan well-choreographed combat? Any specific movies or shows besides The Mandalorian?. Drunken Master and other Jackie Chan films are up my alley. Well-choreographed fighting is intriguing to me for sure.. Drunken Master is great, he's got such a cool style of fighting. Are you into franchises or film series (if they're good), or are you more of a standalone film fan?. I'm fine with either, Star Wars has a pretty good franchise although I can't say the recent movies are great, but I can take or leave franchises compared to standalone films.. I totally get it, the franchises can often bring quality down. Have you by any chance seen John Wick?. Yes I have, got the chance to see Chapter 2 and 3 in theatres, looking forward to the next iteration.. Ok solid that's a great series. What about You Were Never Really Here?. I haven't heard about that movie, what's it about?. It's a pretty gritty action thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix, where he plays a former mercenary who deals with his trauma by taking down a human trafficking network and rescuing the girls they had captive. Would you be interested in watching the trailer?. Sounds similar to Taken, but sure, I'll give it a go.. It's better than Taken, much more intense and less by-the-numbers. Enjoy!. Thank you!. You should also check out the Kingsmen series, first one was great and second one was kind of ok, but the third one looks much better..

Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting.. Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha.. Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version.. Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/. 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie.. Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film?. Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard.. Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.. Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together!. I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible!. Exactly they carry on their same Avengers likeability to Upward, plus the mom is Julia Louis Dreyfus and she's hillarious too. Oh! That's good! I like her as an actress! I love them in the Avengers!.

I don't know why I never went to see it. You should check it out! It's available on Youtube, Google Play, Prime Video, and Vudu for less the $5!. Are there any other movies that blend comedy and action like Zombieland?. My favorite action/comedy movies are the DeadPool series! You should check those out!. Yeah I loved the first one. I haven't seen part 2 yet though. Is it as good as the first one?. I loved it! All of my friends did too! It's just as good, if not better!. Awesome I think I will check that one out too.. Great!

Maybe it's time to rewatch the whole series. What was Red Dragon about?. It's about the guy that caught Hannibal the first time, Will Graham. He's play by Edward Norton. Years later, Graham is investigating another serial killer and goes to Hannibal for advice. Hannibal, of course, manipulates things for his own end. Ralph Fiennes is the serial killer, who is obsessed with this painting, The Red Dragon and thinks he is possessed by that dragon.. I think that's a good choice.. I hope you enjoy it!.

I will be sure to watch this movie next. Awesome. It's my personal favorite among the Tarantino films. If you're interested in something on the opposite side of the drama factor, 50 First Dates has Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler in it as well.. 50 First Dates was awesome.

The last movie I saw was Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese. I'm looking for a recommendation for another movie trailer like that.. that is a great movie. I would recommend Casino. thats another great Martin Scorsese movie.. I have always wanted to see that, but still haven't. I accept your recommendation.. He is a master of that genre of movie. Yes, I really enjoy sweeping epic films with historical settings. What is your favorite one of his films?. I think at the moment it would be Goodfellas. That's a classic. Have you seen his latest, The Irishman? I have read it shares many qualities with both Goodfellas and Casino.. not yet but i hear it great. Yes, I'm very excited to see it. Even though it is so long.. ", ". the irishman. Can I get a new recommendation? i just saw that movie two nights ago. I really enjoyed it!. Once upon a time in Hollywood. Ah, I saw that a couple years ago but can't remember what it was about? Can you remind me?. It's a 2019 comedy and the director is Quentin Tarantino. Very good. oh! I got that one confused with a different one. I love Quentin Tarantino. Is it available on Netflix? Or do you know where I can stream it?. Rental release date is dec 10th in Redbox. great! I'll check it out next week when it comes to Redbox. Thank you for the recommendation. No problem. oh, I forgot, is this US or is it available ioverseas?. in the US. hmm. I am heading to mexico next week. guess I need to watch it before I go!. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you pick a movie trailer.. Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind?. Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from.. I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up.. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary.. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?. This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright.. I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different?. It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was Ready or Not which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best!. Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend?. I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy.. Thank you so much!. My pleasure to help you with your choices.. I look forward to seeing it!. There are so many horror movies being released compared to years ago and, happily, the quality has improved. As a horror fan. myself. I'm thrilled.. A horror movie will make or break within the first 15 minutes or so for me. I never finish movies for the sake of it but I'm also fairly forgiving about cliche..

Do you think it'll be a good movie, even if the media isn't covering it hardcore like the upcoming Star Wars or past Avengers?. It revolves around the Atlanta olympics bombing suspect Richard Jewell .. I'll have to look into this movie then, sounds like a plausible winner.. I am not too in to the Star Wars or superhero movies. I prefer realistic stories. They've never been my taste either, but the media covers them like no tomorrow.

It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g. Well, the obvious choice is A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It's about Mr. Rogers.. Do we know how long that movie is. Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot.. That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated?. For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie. Oh nice. What is that one about?. It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too.. That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one. You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best.. I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids. Yeah, me too. He was a very interesting guy. Seeing the film might make the kids get into him.. That is true.

I have heard about the book. Haven't watched the movie. From details it looks very emotional. Does the movie have humor element?. It has a slight humor taste but nothing major. Is that what you look for when searching for a movie?. Slight humor works fine. Is it good to watch with kids?. I would say that it could be slightly emotional, but it is a great movie to watch with the family for sure. So many lessons taught and important ones too!. Ok. I accept this movie recommendation.. So would you like to watch the trailer?. Yes. before that do you have any other suggestion?. I definitely could. What are other things that you look for in movies?. some romantic new movies?.

Hello how are you. Good, how are you?. Excellent! Watching a lot of movies during this coronavirus time?. Yes, on Disney and Netflix! Can't really watch them at the theaters right now.. Same here, I'm lucky I took my kids to the movies just in time last week.. Yes! That is good, got some good family time in before you're locked inside for who knows how long.. Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting.. Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha.. Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version.. Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/. 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie.. Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film?. Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard.. Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well.. Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together!. I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible!. Exactly they carry on their same Avengers likeability to Upward, plus the mom is Julia Louis Dreyfus and she's hillarious too. Oh! That's good! I like her as an actress! I love them in the Avengers!. ", ". Hello How are you doing? What kind of movie do you like?. Hi, I'm good. I typically like to watch comedies. I see. Have you heard of or seen the Hangover series? It's pretty cool!. What's it about?. The first Hangover film is the funniest. A group of guys throw a bachelor party at Vegas, forget everything and the groom ends up missing. What do you think?. Oh that sounds cool! I'll definitely look into it, thank you!. Sure thing. Do you like only comedies? Do you like dark humor too?. I pretty much only like comedies, but I can't wait to watch the Hangover series now!. Okay then! Enjoy! It was nice talking to you. Nice talking to you too :). Oops. I think we should discuss more movies. I am trying to show you the trailer. Would you be interested in Hangover III?.

My personal favorite is Casino Royale, one of the more contemporary ones. However, Goldfinger is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old!. I like that one, where he robs the Federal Reserve. Sweet, good choice, that is what I will go with, Goldfinger. I'm glad to hear that! I hope you enjoy it.. Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night.. It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think Casino Royale would be a great second choice if that works for you. In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery.. I think that will work, as that particular one does a good job channeling the older Bond films. Thanks for the effort, and recommendation.. Of course, it was my pleasure.. Have you seen the Bond where he gets married? It is the one with the one-off Bond actor, in-between Connery and Moore. I dont think I have, what year did it come out?. 69, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. He is seen as the Bond closest to the character based in Fleming's Books about Bond. Thats interesting, considering it seems very out of his playboy character to get married.. Definitely, it is a different Bond, in tone. If you like Bond, and want a goofy version check out, In Like Flint, reminds me of an early Austin Powers.

What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. Hello! I like Comedy, Heroes and History Movies. Awesome! When you say history movies, do you mind if they are war movies?. I used to like war movies but now I like them about 20%. Okay! What kind of heroes do you like? Do you like the Marvel/DC Universe type heroes? Or are you open to other kinds? For example, have you heard of I Am Number Four?. Yes I like the Marvel heroes. Never heard of I am Number Four. Awesome! I am Number Four is an exciting and gripping movie about these persons that have powers called legacies. It is based off of a book series. The movie received a lot of good reviews from people that enjoy hero and action. Watching the film actually made me read the series. The trailer is here, if you want to check it out and let me know what you think!. How Many series are there?? And yes I can check the trailer.. This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic. OH wow the movie look very interesting, I wanna see it. Do you have any other recommendation?. Yes! Have you ever seen the movie Hancock with Will Smith? It is an awesome movie about a homeless superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers responsibly, and his growth as he becomes a better superhero.. Yeah I have seen That one.. Awesome! That was a fun movie. Speaking of fun, have you heard about the new Eddie Murphy comedy coming out? It is called Dolemite Is My Name. I am putting it up in a recommendation if you would like to check it out!. Yes i have heard of it. And yeah go ahead. Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named The King that is available on Netflix! It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast.. What is the movie (The King) about??. The story is about Hal, son of King Henry, who is a wayward prince and he reluctantly becomes King after his father passes away. He has to adapt to everything that a King is responsible for: politics, war, relationships, and ruling people!. It looks interesting. The King looks like the guy in Games of Thrones. Isn't it??. That is interesting you say that! While the actor, Timothee Chalamet is not in Game of Thrones, the movie has a LOT of similarities with Game of Thrones! A lot of people that watched that movie enjoyed it because they enjoy the rawness that the movie has, much like Game of Thrones!. I could have sworn he is in Game of Thrones.

Hey there!. Hello!. What have you been up to?. I'm sitting here in my living room trying to think of a new movie to watch. I really like high intensity and motivational movies.. Really? What are some of your favorite movies that you've seen?. Some of the movies I recently seen have been THE JOKER and UNCUT GEMS. The intensity was super high, almost giving me anxiety, but I still loved it.. I loved THE JOKER! Joaquin Phoenix is the man!. Right?! He did an excellent job. I was also really surprised by Adam Sandler's performance, he did a great job as well.. Have you ever heard of GOOD WILL HUNTING?. I actually haven't, care to explain a little bit more about it or who is in it?. It's about a man named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who has a gift for mathematics. He has had to endure some troubles in his life and he needs some guidance from a psychologist played by Robin Williams. Would you be interested in seeing the trailer?. Wow that actually sounds like a great movie! I'm an engineer myself so I feel like I would connect with Matt. I also dearly loved Robin Williams, so it will be nice to see him acting. Yes, would definitely be interested in watching the trailer.. Well that's good, I would highly recommend watching the trailer a little bit before taking the time to buy it just in case, lol. When you buy movies, where or how do you should buy them from?. I personally try to rent movies, it's cheaper, or I use a subscription service to watch my movies. What about you?. I used to rent them from a REDBOX which is outside of 7/11's and you can rent them for like $1, but I just pay a little bit more and rent them on my smart tv which is more convenient.. ", ". Hello! How are you today?. I'm doing really good. How are you?. Great, thanks for asking! I hope I can find you a good movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie you'd like to see?. I like romantic comedies best, but I also like movies based on true events.. What was the last romantic comedy you watched?. The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler. He's one of my favorites. The music is always great in his movies.. Cool! Haven't seen that one in forever. So are you looking for something similar?. Yes! I like that endearing hopefulness, with the really sweet, good guy. You know the kind, where love just sort of sneaks up on them!. Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz?. I like them both! They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals.. If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it. It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though. I can tell you more about it if you'd like.. I've heard some really good reviews about that one. I'd love to hear more about it. And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please.. Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true.. So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level.. She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc.... Cool--sounds interesting. I'd love to watch it. I accept your recommendation!.

Looking for some good movie recommendations?. Yes I am.. Well you have come to the right place. What type of movies are you in the mood to see?. I'm in the mood for Christmas horror movies and action.. I like you style! Are there any xmas horror or action movies that you have seen in the past that you really liked?. Yes. Hobbes&Shaw, Krampus, a Christmas Nightmare, and Silent Night Deadly Night.. Nice! Krampus and Christmas Nightmare are some of my favorites.A nightmare before Christmas is a solid Disney classic if you have never seen it. If you want scarier (that's not animated), go for Jack Frost. For action (and christmas) If you haven't seen Die Hard (there is also a second one), you should for sure start there. It's a classic and one of my favorites all time.. I will definately watch a Nightmare Before Christmas and Jack Frost. I have already seen die hard. Yet I must leave since I am about to go out and pick up some DVD's.. Sweet! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Don't get too scared ;). Oh I will enjoy them since this is how I celebrate christmas. Do you have any other Christmas horror movie reccomendations?. My personal favorite is Follow. I love the cast and it's definitely a good thriller that keeps your heart racing for a majority.. What was your experience with Follow?. I saw it a few years ago back when it first came out and watch it every December. I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect.. If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies .. Oh hands down! I believe it's on Amazon Prime now, but I still watch on the original DVD like a movie nerd lol. Enjoy!. I prefer original DVD's rather than streaming or downloadable mediums.. Same! Not too many people like us out there anymore! I really hope you enjoy your movie watching :). Oh that is for sure. The local shop I buy CD's and records from is where I purchase most of my DVDs, and I also enjoy VHS tapes.. That's awesome! I'm the same way and loveeee VHS tapes too. I'm so bummed my VCR broke a few months ago and finding a brand new one at a decent price is surprisingly difficult. Also side note, I know we are here for movies, but there is nothing like listening to a record on a chilly winter night.. Have you considered asking for help at your local Makerspace to help repair your VCR?. ", ". Hello! How are you?. Hey! I'm great, how about you? I am in the mood for a movie trailer.. Great! I love movies! What is the latest movie you have watched?. I watched Billy Madison while I was visiting my sister over Thanksgiving.. I love that movie! Adam Sandler and Chris Farley are the best! What did you like about it and what did you not like about it?. I also really like Adam Sandler, but not his newer movies. I liked that it was just silly funny. There was really nothing that I didn't like.. Would you like a recommendation for a movie similar to that one? I also prefer old Adam Sandler movies. They were more light hearted and real!. Yes, I really enjoyed it, so I would love something similar.. Are you a Will Ferrell fan as well? I love his comedies and they can be kind of similar to old Sandler movies!. I really don't like him. I know most people do, but he's not my jam. I kind of want an Adam Sandler one again.. Have you ever seen Happy Gilmore? It is from the same time period as Billy Madison and is a laugh riot!. YES, that is perfect!! I saw parts of it once at a party, but I couldn't remember what it was called! Thank you, I accept that recommendation!. It is a great movie. A classic Adam Sandler movie. It almost makes you forget all the recent ones he has tried to do!. Totally! Thanks, again!. No problem! I always enjoy recommending movies. I hope you enjoy it!. I'm sure I will! I've been trying to remember the name for a long time!. ", ". Hello, I'm here to help you with finding a movie trailer. hi, i am looking at the sonic the hedgehog movie..

I do know of a movie that I want to see because I think it will be good. It's called Doctor Sleep.. ", ". Hi! Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in?. I normally love comedies.. Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?. I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though.. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?. That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres?. I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?. I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy.. Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!. I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it.. Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!. That does sound pretty perfect!. I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy.. I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha!. Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself.. I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;). Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it.. Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie?. ", ". Hello! Can I help recommend a movie trailer for you?. I would love for you to find me an action movie. Okay! Do you like real world action, like war movies? Or do you prefer fantasy type action?. i prefer war movie. Have you heard of Dunkirk? Its a war movie about the Allies retreat from France during World War II.. No, i have not heard of that. Its an interesting film. It follows three different story lines to tell its history. I personally like the fighter pilots story.. Wow, i will definitely try that out. Tom Hardy is the pilot. Do you know him? He played Bane in the Dark Knight Rises and is the lead in Venom.. Yes i know Tom Hardy. Yeah, I think hes a great actor. This movie also won 3 oscars, if that helps!. Yeah it does help. Also, I just realized Christopher Nolan directed it. He also directed the Dark Knight movies. So, if you like the action in those movie, Im sure youd like Dunkirk.. great i will check them out. Awesome, the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes are great, too, in case you rely on reviews for movies.. i will definitely check them out. Cool! I hope you enjoy it!. yes i did thanks for your time. Thank you!. you welcome, do you have any other thing in mind?. Well, there is another movie I like called War Horse. Ever heard of it?. Yes i have heard of that.

I am interested in a romance is there anything that you would recommend?. Have you seen To all the boys i still love you on netflix? Part 1 came out last year, and part 2 was recently released! It plays off the narrative of the first one and has some very interesting romances/flings/secret relationships... Plus it has some heart warming comedy. Do you like any other movie types?. No, I haven't see that movie. What is it about? Who play in that movie? I love all kind of movies but more interested in a romance at the moment.. the first one is actually called To all the boys I've loved before and the second is called To all the boys p.s. I still love you. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes. Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy! The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time. She has to choose one of them though, who will it be?. OH WOW! I know she was like OMG. I am curious on how the letters got out. I glad that never happened to me. I am also curious on who will it be as well.. You should watch the movie so you can find out. It stars a handful of Netflix's new age of top actors and actresses like Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, and Janel Parrish.. Okay awesome I will watch it thank you.

Also action/drama. I am obsessed with Harry Potter! So hard to compare to other movies. Do you have a movie you've watched recently that you liked?. Not really. Honestly movies can easily pu me to sleep so I like something engaging to hold my interest. A good example is The Matrix.. I can tell you like a lot of suspense and action. Have you watched or thought about watching the Mission Impossible movies? Tom Cruise gives a great story!. I have not watched or thought about those. That's a good suggestion I think. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan but maybe I'd enjoy the films.. Perhaps based off your enjoyment of Harry Potter you like a more fantasy style of action. I really love to watch Lord of the Rings with my family. It is a very wild and action filled plot set in another world with magic. Do you think those movies would interest you?. Absolutely! I've seen them and although lengthy, I was captivated and enjoyed them a lot. I also am interested in anything about King Arthur or Merlin. Amazing! I feel like we have similar tastes so I would like to recommend Mortal Engines for you to view.. Really? Mortal Engines. I have never heard of it but on your advise, I would check it out.. In is based off a book like the movies you have previously mentioned. You follow a girl in a post-apocalyptic world trying to fight for a better world. Do you think you would watch this movie trailer?. Yes! It interests me.. Perfect! You have a great taste in movies and I think that you may really enjoy this movie.

Awesome, I am so glad that I could help your search in your movie preferences.. I wrote the title down so I will remember. ....Mortal Engines. Haha I love that. Have a great day and Enjoy!. Thanks so much. You have a great day also....by the way ....where are you right now?? I'm just curious. I am in Michigan.. I am in Florida :). oooh lucky. ", ". Hello, I'm here to help you find a good movie trailer!. Hello, thanks for helping me.. Sure thing! What genre of movie do you usually watch?. I like action and fantasy. I also like good character driven movies.. Me too. Movies where someone grows throughout the story are somehow really rewarding to watch. What would you say is your favorite movie that you've seen in the last year?. Thats hard to say. The last Avengers movie was really good.. ?Ohh, that movie gave me so many different emotions. Thor had me laughing so hard, but I sobbed at the funeral for Black Widow. If you liked that movie, have you thought of watching Spiderman: Far From Home?. I have thought about seeing that movie. Is it any good?. I really enjoyed it! The interesting part to me was seeing how Peter's friends from the first movie play such a large role in helping him as Spiderman, considering that I would usually think of Spiderman as a loner by necessity. It made me think about the character in a different way.. That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner. I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner. Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film. I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion.. You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different. Sure thing! And if you have not seen the first one yet, Spider-Man Homecoming, make sure to give that a watch first!. Will do thanks. Have a good day..

Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable! There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny!. Oh I don't know if I heard of that one? What is it about?

What kind of movies do you like to watch. mostly dramas and comedy. Ok cool. So i rate movies depending on if they make me cry or not. if I cry that means its a great movie like the movie 50/50. have you seen that movie?. no I haven't seen that one, what is it about?. Its about a guy who is very healthy and he ends up getting cancer and he only has a 50% chance to live and his bestfriend Seth Rogan helps him get through it. 100% must watch movie to get you emotional. I will definitely have to check that one out. Thanks for the recomendation. Some other recomendations would be Jojo rabbit and Parasite. both comedy with some drama. Great movies to watch.. ok sounds great. Have you seen the new Bad Boys movie yet? I want to go see it but I haven't heard if it's good or not.. ", ". Hello, I would like to help you find a film that you would enjoy.. That would be great.. What kind of movies do you usually enjoy?. I like anything that has a good storyline. I watch all types of movies. I am thinking a good comdey.. Are there any actors you usually enjoy in a comedy?. I do like Kevin Hart or Will Farrow.. The Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle remake has Kevin Hart in it and is a lot of fun. It's a great comedy that you can watch with the whole family.. Has that one came out yet. I didn't think it was out.. It came out in 2017. It also stars the Rock.. Oh ok yeah I saw that one. I did see there was a new one coming out. Do you have anything else in mind?. Night School is another good one with Kevin Hart if you want a comedy for a date night.. I forgot about that one. I do like that recommendation accept that one.. Great! I am glad I could help you.. Thanks so much would be watching that tonight. Is it kid friendly or adults only?. It's rated PG-13 so probably best for adults only or with teens.. Oh in that case as a back up for the kids.Do you have another you would recommend?. Since it's the holidays and you like Will Ferrell, Elf is a great comedy to watch with the kids.. Yeah that one would be perfect.. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you pick a movie trailer.. Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind?. Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from.. I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up.. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary.. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?. This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright.. I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different?. It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was Ready or Not which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best!. Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend?. I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy.. Thank you so much!.

I am here to help you find a movie trailer. what is your favorite genre?. Hey, my favorite genre is Rom Com.. oh that is great! mine too! what is the latest you have seen? i recently watched The Switch. Have you seen that one?. No, and it doesn't sound familiar.. Jennifer Aniston stars in that one next to Jason Bateman. Do you like them? would you be interested in me telling you a little about The Switch or is there a certain Rom-Com movie you already had an idea of.. Oh okay, I know the movie switch. I didn't really like that one. Okay not a problem. A more recent one that was released in 2019 with the always funny Rebel Wilson called Isn't it Romantic is like a female version of Shallow Hal starring Jack Black. have you already seen those.. I've seen shallow hal but not this isn't it romantic. What else do you know about that. So Rebel Wilson feels she is unworthy of love because of her weight and is super self conscious. she hits her head and when she awakes she has all this new confidence and puts herself out there. she realizes she is in a Rom-Com but thinks its a dream so she plays along. Gets to date a very handsome man. but learns more about herself at the same time. does that sound like something you might be interested in seeing?. Yes! I would love that recommendation!!!!. awesome while I get the link for the movie. let me just add this a great date night movie so dont forget the popcorn and candy ;-). Lol if my SO wasn't up north for work and liked Rom Coms. ", ". Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes. Truly one of Keanu Reeves' best movies since the Matrix trilogy in my opinion.. I dont think i have seen those before, what genre are they?. I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times.. okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre?. I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. ", ". Hello there! I am here to help recommend a movie trailer for you!. yes sure. what kind of movies do you prefer?. comedy. what is the latest comedy you have watched?. dog days. Oh, I haven't seen the movie. Who acts in it?. a lot of differents actor. oh I see, is it a new movie?. i think not so new. I'm try to show you my recommendation. Sorry. no problem.

What type of movies have you watched in the last couple months?. jojo rabbit, knives out, shadow. I would first recommend Gemini Man with Will Smith. Awesome movie with plenty of action but also some plot twists that lead to an interesting plot.. I have not seen that movie yet. I've thought of watching it maybe. It highly recommend it. Smith rarely disappoints. Another one would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood if you like Tarantino movies or Ford vs Ferrari for a combination historical/suspense movie.. I will definitely watch it soon then. Tarantino's movies are the best. Excellent. Enjoy! Good chatting with you.. good bye. I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view. I will try to view them. buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot. They occasionally do. From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover. There are enough other twists hidden in the movie.. my favorite movie of will smith is Men in black. but he also does serious movies also.. This will in line with his normal level of acting. Throwing in suttle humor while not losing the mood of the scene.. I'm just glad he is still in movies. I agree. It's fun to see long time actors also evolve into other roles. Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of BelAir to his movie roles now are night and day but it is still authentically him.. I forgot Gemini Man was himself against himself from the trailer. after rewatching it. ", ". Hi! So what type of movie genre's do you like to watch?. Mostly science-fiction, or action movies.

What was the last movie you saw? What was good/bad about it?. The last one I saw was the latest Purge movie and I really enjoyed that. The good was though theme was the same, there were some resistance beginning to be considered. The bad was the purge violence appeared a bit forced, but I liked it.. I saw that too! The purge are pretty good movies. Last one I saw wat It2! It was pretty good and we liked it. You have to watch the first one first to get connected to the story.. I saw the first one and loved it. What was also good about the second one was that they brought back a couple of the Purge 1 cast; that was cool. I'm looking forward to a movie coming out during Christmas; saw a preview of it; but did'nt catch the name. I'll be looking for that one!!!. Didnt catch the name? Who was in it? What was it about?. I remember; it is Black Christmas and it's about a college campus where they're preparing for the holiday when the murders begin. Looks like my kind of movie.. I recommend seeing it!. Black Christmas it is and I accept your recommendation!. I watched the trailer. Looks pretty good. Some people might call the name of the movie racist.. I don't see it that way. Some people are too sensitive. I'm not and I don't see it that way at all!. I agree! I dont recognize any stars in the trailer.. No, neither did I, but you know they bring in newbies when making a movie like this; remember Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween. She did great!. Yeah! That was a long time ago! Makes me feel old!. I know. Don't feel old because I am really old and still love watching all of the Halloweens on Halloween and all of the Friday the 13th's on Friday the 13th. Hilarious!.

Oh, yes! Or Wedding Crashers with Vince Vahn and Owen Wilson as well. Both classics!. haha, yes. now we are on the same page. I also like Alec Baldwin in The Departed with Leo. That movie is great.\\. I highly recommend Vantage Point with Sigourney Weaver and Dennis Quaid. It's action-packed, and it shows the same crime from various perspectives. Putting together the pieces from each character's viewpoint helps the audience to solve the mystery of who committed the crime!. Wow...I just looked it up and it looks really good.

Good evening. Do you have any recommendations. What kind of movies do you like?. Action movies. Who is your favorite actor?. Edward nortan. Hmmm. Not sure who he is. You got me there. Have you seen The Joker?. No have you seen call of the wild with Harrison ford. I have not seen that one yet. Want to. Looks really good. What is the last movie you watched?. Field of dreams you. ", ". Hello. Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you?. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style?. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.. Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being. Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.. The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play.. I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.. You are welcome. An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these.. Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.. I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones!. If you are ever curious what became of Oscar Wilde there is a 2018 movie, THE HAPPY PRINCE that explains what became of him. Subsequently, explaining why we haven't heard from him after a certain period of time.. That sounds quite interesting too, I will do some research on that now. That was another movie type I forgot to mention liking, autobiography I guess it would be called? telling the story of someones life works and such. Yes...Oscar Wilde is an interesting character to learn about. Don't forget to have tea and pastries for your movie night. A good idea with a Victorian themed movie date. HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT....good night. Thank you again for the wonderful suggestions, I researched The Happy Prince and will definitely look into watching that as well, and what a wonderful idea setting up some tea and pastries for movie night snacks, bravo! I accept your recommendations, you have a goodnight too. Thanks again!. ", ". Hello. hey. What is your favorite movie?. I really like the boy in the striped pajamas.

It's the 3rd movie in a series by Rob Zombie following the Firefly family after they were arrested for gruesome murders. That's interesting. Rob Zombie like the artist?. yes, his movies are awesome. Can you tell me more about the movie. they escape from jail and try to hide in mexico, but they get into trouble and have to kill a bunch of people to escape. Hm. Could you select the trailer for me to watch?. Ok, In order for it to make sense, you need to watch House of 1000 Corpses first.. Ok sounds good :). The soundtrack is awesome. oh, I bet. Can't wait to see it. ", ". Hello! I am here to help you finda movie trailer. Hi! I'd love to get a recommendation!. Which type of movies do you like to watch? adventure? horror? comedy?. I love horror. Those movies are my favorite. I especially like the ones that are sort of an atmospheric, slow burn (and love when things are open to interpretation). Horror is my favorite as well. Please give me a minute to see what is out!. No worries! If it helps, ghost movies are my favorite (but I'll pretty much watch any type of horror). Scary stories to tell in the dark is out now. It is about a a little girl that writes scary that come alive. I hear it is pretty good.. Yeah! I've actually been meaning to check it out. I used to read the books when I was a kid. Thank you for the recommendation! I accept it :). Awesome!! I hope you enjoy. Thank you!. You are welcome.If that doesnt work out check out 'It chapter 2. Awesome! I saw the first one when it came out. I thought it was funnier than it was scary, but I still enjoyed it. Thanks for that recommendation too! I also accept it (but will check out Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark first, lol)!. The first one was really good. Yeah, I thought the actors did a great job! I'm interested in seeing how they focus on their adult versions in the second one. Have you seen it (the second one that is)?. ", ". the irishman. Can I get a new recommendation? i just saw that movie two nights ago. I really enjoyed it!. Once upon a time in Hollywood. Ah, I saw that a couple years ago but can't remember what it was about? Can you remind me?. It's a 2019 comedy and the director is Quentin Tarantino. Very good. oh! I got that one confused with a different one. I love Quentin Tarantino. Is it available on Netflix? Or do you know where I can stream it?. Rental release date is dec 10th in Redbox. great! I'll check it out next week when it comes to Redbox. Thank you for the recommendation. No problem. oh, I forgot, is this US or is it available ioverseas?. in the US. hmm. I am heading to mexico next week. guess I need to watch it before I go!. Do you have any recommendation for me?. Have you watched Kill the Irishman?. No yet. It's a god one?. yes, It's an older movie. 2011 But it's on Netflix. It was recommended to me after I watched The Irishman.

Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?. I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though.. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?. That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres?. I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?. I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy.. Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!. I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it.. Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!. That does sound pretty perfect!. I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy.. I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha!. Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself.. I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;). ", ". Hey there. What kind of moives do you like?. Most type of movies. Well not war movies or sports as much! A good comedy or love story sign me up!. ", ". How are you doing today?. Hey, I'm good! How are you?. Good just thinking about watching a movie.

I really enjoy actions movies, in general.. What do you like about them?. I like the fast pace of the film. I like watching someone do something on screen that I can't.. Same here! Joker is a really great origin story, but if you like an action-packed comedy, I'd really recommend Zombieland 2.. I've heard really good things about Joker. It may be a bit too dark for me. What is the plot about?. It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character. It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character.. Hm, sounds very interesting. I do like comic book movies as well. What is the plot of Zombieland 2?. Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse. The second movie shows them years later as they have grown into more of a family unit, and some drama threatens their relationship.. The plot sounds pretty scary and funny. Who stars in Zombieland 2?. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.. Wow, I really like Woody Harrelson's acting. That sounds like a good movie. Who was the director?. It's directed by Ruben Fleischer. Zombieland is his best known movie!. Did you see the 1st film? Do you think I would have to see the 1st film to understand the 2nd?. I did see the first film, but everything is explained pretty well in the second one so you wouldn't need to see the first film to understand.. That sounds good. I'll accept your recommendation of Zombieland 2.. ", ". Hi! Did you enjoy a nice Thanksgiving?. Hello! Yes, I had a very pleasant and nice Thanksgiving. Same for you I hope?. Yes, yes. It's one of the times my family actually sits and watches a movie. We love Disney movies. Do you?. Yeah, I enjoyed Disney movies a lot growing up but haven't seen any of the newer ones recently. I was maybe thinking of watching some of them though.. What type movies to you typically enjoy?. I'll watch any movie to be honest. Though I like actions, comedy, historical or sci-fi films the most. A nice looking animated film is also pleasant to look at.. Same here. Who do you usually watch movies with? I often watch with my kids, but enjoy a night where I can see something with a more complicated plot.. I live by myself, so I usually watch movies alone barring the rare time I have a friend or family member over or I'm at their place and we watch something.. It would be nice to enjoy the quiet and watch a good historical movie. What was the last movie you watched?. The last movie I watched was actually Us, the Jordan Peele directed film earlier this year.. Oh, Maybe you would like Get Out also directed by Jordan Peele. I've seen that already. I would actually wanted to watch something lighter after seeing Us. Maybe a newer Disney film from the past few years since you mentioned that earlier.. If you haven't seen any of the newer Disney movies, I think you would enjoy Frozen and also Frozen 2 that is currently in theaters. It is one of the best Disney movies.. How is Frozen as a movie? All I know about it is the Let it Go and Build a Snowman songs?. It is a little different in that it isn't the traditional saved by the prince. It is about the strength in family/sibling love. But, there are some great comedic moments as well. And, the music is really good.. Sounds interesting. Would you recommend I see over the other Disney animated films from the last few years?

Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol.

Oh wow, I've never heard of it but that sounds like something I'd be interested in. I'll have to check it out.. It's really fun! I heard that Warwick Davis is tied to a sequel for the movie Willow for Disney + but it's been many years since I saw the original. No word on Val Kilmer coming back yet. He's great in everything.. Oh, I didn't know that. Thank you for the recommendation, I'll be watching that soon.. Cool! It's nice to dig up old obscure movies, especially since I've seen too much Netlflix. That's true. I'm always looking for new things to watch. Are there any other movies you would suggest?. Goon on Netflix is a low-budget comedy movie about a hockey player. It did very poorly at the box office but it's now a cult classic.. That's a good one, I saw that a while back. I thought it was pretty good but I could see why the ratings wouldn't be great. I still haven't seen the second one.. I've seen about half of it. Pretty funny, same characters. Need to finish it. Cool, I'll have to watch that. I enjoy all kinds of movies. Thanks again.. sure thing, this is fun. I agree. I've been watching a lot of movies lately so I could use recommendations..

Hello how are you?. I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary.. Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?. My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard.. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.. The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated?. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.. Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions?. Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore. I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train.. ", ". Hi! Are you looking for a movie trailer?. Yes, i am do you have any recommendations?. ", ". Hi how is your day. Hey there! It's been pretty good. I've been looking for something interesting to watch lately.. What kind of things do you like to watch.. I tend to lean more towards horror movies but I have a guilty pleasure for romantic comedy, too.. I love to watch horror movies myself! What is the last move that you have seen?. It's been awhile since I've watched a good horror movie. I think the last one that I watched was probably IT and I tend to watch the Scream movies over and over again. I like good horror movies that make you think, have good characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.. Those are the best kinds of movies when you are on the edge of your seat. I love that penny wise smile, nothing will ever compare to it. Have you ever seen any of the Insidious series?. I don't think that I have! Are they any good? What are they about?. They are one of my favorite scary movies. They all follow a different person every movie but it is about someone being taken into a different dimension of the world they live in.. That sounds like it perfectly describes a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just my kind of movie! I'd love to give them a try and start watching as soon as I can. Thanks for the recommendation!. They are a little bit of an older movie but I really enjoy them and will watch them over and over.. They sound like a perfect recommendation for me!. The movie has had 8 wins and 15 nominations for awards.. How do you feel about the acting in the movie? Is it cheesy or do they do a nice job?.

How are you doing?. I am great, i am actually looking for a movie recommendation. Cool! I just got done watching John Wick 3 gotta love Keanu Reeves. What type of movies are you into.. well i like romantic and comedies. What's the last movie that you watched?. parasite hahaha. Lol! That is definitely on my watch list. What is your favorite comedy?. to all the boys i've loved before. Well if you loved that one you should definitely check out the second movie To all the boys: P.S. I still love you! It was amazing. oh great, thank you i will definitely watch this one.. You won't regret it Lana Condor delivers as always! She. thank you bye. ", ". Hello! I would like to help you find a movie trailer to watch.. yes..pls. What genre of movies do you most like to watch?. Action movies. Awesome. What was the most recent movie you saw? Did you like it?. Terminator Dark fate. ", ". hi!. Hi. what kinds of movies do you see in the theater, versus watching at home?. Hmm...I like seeing movies with friends in theaters whereas at home I prefer just to watch by myself. Usually in theaters it is a big blockbuster or something recent.. that big screen is a definite for big blockbusters! i take it action is your thing then? are you into the comic book movies that are popular now?. Not really into comic book based moveis. More into space or time travel movies.. oh yea! interstellar is a personal favorite of mine. have you seen donnie darko before? jake gyllenhaal is pretty young in it. I really liked interseller and donnie darko is one of my favorite films. Are there others like them you would recommend?. of course! time travel movies tend to fall on the funny or serious side, it sounds like a more serious one is up your alley. edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it?. I am not, though I like tom cruise movies.. this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about). Interesting. Did the movie have different names in different markets?. yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt. lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others?. looper is about time travelling to kill people (it's not as dark as that sounds), its a really interesting take on time travel with bruce willis and joseph gordon-levitt. not a spoiler, but joseph gordon-levitt plays a younger version of bruce willis. I saw looper and really liked it. Looper is a good recommendation. I also liked inception. Are there anymore like that?. cant mention time travel assassins without bringing up terminator or terminator 2...a real interesting take on the action/futuristic space genre is hardcore henry, the entire movie is shot first person. Oh, I hadn't thought of looking back that far. I'll check out both terminator and terminator 2. I accept your recommendation.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["You are welcome bye", "Cool.

Hobbes&Shaw, Krampus, a Christmas Nightmare, and Silent Night Deadly Night.. Nice! Krampus and Christmas Nightmare are some of my favorites.A nightmare before Christmas is a solid Disney classic if you have never seen it. If you want scarier (that's not animated), go for Jack Frost. For action (and christmas) If you haven't seen Die Hard (there is also a second one), you should for sure start there. It's a classic and one of my favorites all time.. I will definately watch a Nightmare Before Christmas and Jack Frost. I have already seen die hard.

Oh I will enjoy them since this is how I celebrate christmas. Do you have any other Christmas horror movie reccomendations?. My personal favorite is Follow. I love the cast and it's definitely a good thriller that keeps your heart racing for a majority.. What was your experience with Follow?. I saw it a few years ago back when it first came out and watch it every December. I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect.. If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies .. Oh hands down! I believe it's on Amazon Prime now, but I still watch on the original DVD like a movie nerd lol. Enjoy!. I prefer original DVD's rather than streaming or downloadable mediums.. Same! Not too many people like us out there anymore! I really hope you enjoy your movie watching :). Oh that is for sure.

I love Jennifer Aniston! Have you seen The Switch?. The switch was fantastic. Jenniefer was a revelation. I totally agree. I love Jason Bateman too, he's such a dad and absolutely hilarious. Have you seen Juno?. I haven't seen that one. What's it about?. It came out in like 2007 so it's a little older but it's about this teenage girl who accidentally gets pregnant by one of her best friends, and then how she deals with the aftermath of that.

Oh I recently watched that on Netflix! That is a Coen Brothers film. Do you generally like movies by the Coen Brothers?. Yes, They are good movies. One of my favorite Coen Brothers films is Miller's Crossing. It seems lesser known than their other movies. Have you seen it?. I have not, I will have to look in to it. I think the movie highlights the Coen Brother's ability to make a compelling movie even toward the beginning of their carreer. It also stars John Turturro who has been in many of their movies since..

Hello. Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me?. Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc.... I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama.. Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.. It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining.. I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it.. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL. I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!. No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split.. I just watched Split recently! I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.. That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for Unbreakable. Honestly, I'm glad Split came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now.. That's so true. I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days. But sometimes, I think movies like Star Wars rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan.. YES!! To be honest though, I like more and more movies coming out don't have enough originality. So movie company rather throw in an explosion or two just to make the more captivating.. I totally agree. I really appreciate action movies that have a great plot and character development.. Sorry for my lack of words the last comment. I reread what I typed and it made no sense. Yes, action movies are great but almost all the actions movies that are released are comic book based or unoriginal. I have yet to see a movie that's not based on a book or a documentary of some kind.. That's true. Maybe because they're the easiest to merchandise. I feel like that's a big consideration of production companies these days. One original action movie that I saw recently was another Korean film called The Man From Nowhere. There's a great sub-genre of Korean action films that just focus on revenge. Do you know any other films like that?. ", ". Hi! Did you enjoy a nice Thanksgiving?. Hello! Yes, I had a very pleasant and nice Thanksgiving. Same for you I hope?. Yes, yes. It's one of the times my family actually sits and watches a movie. We love Disney movies. Do you?. Yeah, I enjoyed Disney movies a lot growing up but haven't seen any of the newer ones recently. I was maybe thinking of watching some of them though.. What type movies to you typically enjoy?. I'll watch any movie to be honest. Though I like actions, comedy, historical or sci-fi films the most. A nice looking animated film is also pleasant to look at.. Same here. Who do you usually watch movies with? I often watch with my kids, but enjoy a night where I can see something with a more complicated plot.. I live by myself, so I usually watch movies alone barring the rare time I have a friend or family member over or I'm at their place and we watch something.. ", ". Hello there. Hi. I hear you're looking for a movie trailer. Can I ask, what is the last movie that you watched?. I watched Creed 2. Do you think you would like to a movie similar to that, or different?.

For instance, I really enjoyed the first Saw movie but then they got kind of ridiculous.. What is the last horror movie you watched recently?. The Orphanage. That's a good one. What was your favorite part of the movie?. I liked the twist ending, how he was left in the closet all along. I enjoy surprises like that (kind of like Saw at the end).. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer.. Great, what do you have to show me?. Wha kind of movies do you prefer?. I like comedies and suspense. I don't like horror..

Do you enjoy animated comedies? Or perfer to keep watch more adult movies?. I am open to either. I have kids so I see a lot of animation when going out with them.. On the animated front, Frozen 2 had its moments of humor. Great music as well. And plenty of references for parents to catch.. OK. I have not seen that yet. I would like to see that trailer..

I am here to try to find a movie trailer that you would like to view. Are you ready?. Hello! I am well, thanks! I am ready!. First off, what is your favorite kind of movie to watch - drama, action, comedy, etc?. I definitely don't care a lot for drama. I would say horror/thriller, action, and comedy are probably my favorite genres.. Those are my favorites too! Have you seen the latest Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise?. I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list.. I would have to agree with you on this. I think half of the movie was chase scenes of one sort or another.. It can be fun, but bot when it takes up most of the movie.. Have you seen any of the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise? While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot.. I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting.. You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!. Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?. The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!. Thanks for that information. I am definitely interested in this and accept your recommendation.. Great! Glad I could help! Hope you enjoy the trailer and enjoy the movie!. Thanks again. Do you happen to know how many movies are out about this character?. There are two in this series so far, with a new one out soon. The first was Jack Reacher in 2012 and then Jack Reacher: Never Go Back in 2016.. Awesome. So If I like it, there are additional ones to watch!.

If you like action movies you may like the new called The Batman.. but which of them can i seew. The Batman comes out later. It will definitely be one a will be seeing as soon as it comes out. 1917 is out now. It is a great war movie. The director really did a great job keep the scenes authentic to the war.. oh I see, I will wait for this movie it look very interesting so thanks you for you recomendation. You're welcome. Hope you have a great day!. so maybe you have another movie to recomend me about action. Another action movie I enjoyed is Maverick. I comes out in June but it is a must see film.

Thank you. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. I would like to see some trailers for upcoming horror movies.. I love horror movies! One of my favorites is The Shining and I really enjoyed the recent prequel, Dr. Sleep. What are some of your favorites?. I like Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween. Awesome Jamie Lee Curtis plays a great role! Are you looking for something similar?. Yes. I like Jamie Lee Curtis in the new Halloween, so I'd like to see something similar to that. Okay great! Any other horror movie preferences?. I like it when the villain is articulate like in Hellraiser. ", ". Hello! Can I help you find a movie trailer?. Yes, please! I want to see a movie over the holidays and I'm curious about what you might suggest and I'm looking for a recommendation.. Are you wanting a holiday themed movie or are you open to other ideas as well?. I'm open to other ideas. I tend to like action movies and I can't stand horror flicks. Too scary. I like it when movies have a lot of character development.. I don't like horror either! Way too scary. What was the last movie that you watched?. The last movie I watched was Captain Marvel and I really liked it.. Yes! Great movie. Let me see what I can find that I think you will like.. Awesome. Like I said, I like action films and I typically like nerdy films like Star Wars or Marvel stuff. I like witty humor and banter rather than slap-stick type humor. I like a complex, yet understandable plot. Nothing too out there like Inception or anything.. 21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see. With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion.. Hmm, I've never heard of it. What's the gist? I'm assuming about police shooting people? I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda.. It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run.. Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction?. It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies!. Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like my type of movie. I will definitely go see it considering that plot and that actor. Thanks for your recommendation! I'll go see that movie over the holiday.. Great! I hope you really enjoy it and have a happy holiday!. For sure, thanks.. You're welcome!. One last thing, I suppose. I was also considering seeing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Do you think 21 Bridges would be a better movie?. Oh that's a tough one! Star Wars is a great franchise and I would hate for you to miss out on that in the theater setting. For me though, I would prefer 21 Bridges and reserve Star Wars for another day.. Hmm, maybe it would be a good idea to see both of them? But, I still think I'll see 21 Bridges since you recommended it..

Let me know your thoughts ?", "That is correct, it came out in 1997.", "Have you seen <movie>?"], "retrieved_contexts": [". Hello from across the miles. hello!. so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation?. thats correct! Can you help?. Of Course ! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like ? what genre if I may ask ?... I typically like action movie! bUt ones that make you think, not just ones with a lot of explosions. What was the last movie you watched ? either rented of went to the theatre.. I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that. Well I recently watched Call me by Your Name, and it was beautiful; both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning. May I tell you a little about it ?.. that doesnt really seem like its my style. well theres the Kevin Costner movie, Three days to Kill.. thats full of action, as he and his estranged daughter reconcile,, its quite thought provoking,, ;-). I have actually seen that one and I thought it was a little boring because it was more about killing time with his daughter. My favorite movie of all time is Jack Reacher. what about the new The Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford ? thats a great movie !. I think that looks interesting! Ill accept that recommendation!. Great ! The story follows Buck, a domestic dog who finds himself in the wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the late 1800s. Based on the 1903 Jack London book of the same name, the movie stars Harrison Ford as Bucks owner, John Thornton.. Sounds cool!!. ", ". Hey there!. Hello!. What have you been up to?. I'm sitting here in my living room trying to think of a new movie to watch. I really like high intensity and motivational movies.. Really? What are some of your favorite movies that you've seen?. Some of the movies I recently seen have been THE JOKER and UNCUT GEMS. The intensity was super high, almost giving me anxiety, but I still loved it.. I loved THE JOKER! Joaquin Phoenix is the man!. Right?! He did an excellent job. I was also really surprised by Adam Sandler's performance, he did a great job as well.. Have you ever heard of GOOD WILL HUNTING?. I actually haven't, care to explain a little bit more about it or who is in it?. It's about a man named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who has a gift for mathematics. He has had to endure some troubles in his life and he needs some guidance from a psychologist played by Robin Williams. Would you be interested in seeing the trailer?. Wow that actually sounds like a great movie! I'm an engineer myself so I feel like I would connect with Matt. I also dearly loved Robin Williams, so it will be nice to see him acting. Yes, would definitely be interested in watching the trailer.. Well that's good, I would highly recommend watching the trailer a little bit before taking the time to buy it just in case, lol. When you buy movies, where or how do you should buy them from?. I personally try to rent movies, it's cheaper, or I use a subscription service to watch my movies. What about you?. I used to rent them from a REDBOX which is outside of 7/11's and you can rent them for like $1, but I just pay a little bit more and rent them on my smart tv which is more convenient.. Yeah, I'm a college student who can't really afford a nice smart tv, so a laptop is all I generally use.. Don't worry, I was doing the same as well. All of my movie watching was on my laptop. The movie you just mentioned, is an older movie right?. ", ". What kind of movies are you interested in?. I like sappy feel good movies.. What would you say your favorite movie is in that genre?. Forest Gump was a good one.. Do you enjoy more rom com or adventure feel good?. I like adventure feel good movies. A little excitement makes all the better.. Have you ever seen the movie princess bride?. Ahh, many times and have got so in some parts I tend to speak the dialog in my mind as the actor does.. It really is a great movie, what about Karate Kid?. Yep I have seen that one a couple times too. I like a lot of Tom Hanks movies such as Sleepless in Seattle and BIG.. He really makes some fantastic movies. Yes Have you see his latest?. Which one is that?. The one about the life of Mr. Rogers, just out now I think.. Oh yeah that one looks super good. I will have to see it. Have you seen the movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. No, I have heard of it but haven't ever seen it. Do you know of any good car adventure movies coming out soon?. I dont know of any car adventure movies coming out soon, sorry. Well, I am looking for a good Tom Hanks and I have seen some previews of Mr. Rogers. Looks good for this week.. I cant recommend that movie on here officially because it wont appear on my list. But i really do recommend Secret Life of Walter Mitty, It has adventure, love, and a great storyline.

I liked the fact that the woman is a psychic/medium who went back to her childhood home to get rid of the evil that she released. She found out the secret of many bodies hidden in the house and her dad was a part of it. I disliked how it didn't scare me or make me jump like I would like horror movies to do.. It still sounds like something I'd enjoy. I like horror a lot too. The scariest movies I've ever seen were Event Horizon, Silent Hill and the original Nightmare on Elm Street. Have you seen any of those?. I have seen Silent Hill and Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't remember if I have seen Event Horizon. The name of the movie is familiar, but if I have seen it it has been a long time. I do love the serial killer type movies too. My favorite is Michael Myers. He's my favorite.. I've never seen any of those. But I highly recommend Event Horizon if you haven't seen it. It's about a warp drive engine that opens up a gateway to hell, and has some horrific scenes of demonic entities.. Oh heck yes. Now I am more interested. Well thank you for that recommendation, I will definitely look into it. Why don't you check out the trailer and see if you like it?. That looks like a really interesting movie to watch.

Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot. I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it!. I definitely will check it out - are you a Stephen King fan?. Yes of course! I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie?. The Shining was solid.

I haven't seen that trailor, Linda Hamilton is great. I'm always hesitant with remakes though. Have you seen it?. i have seen it, and it is not a remake, it is a direct sequel to T2. Oh thats cool. Did they replace Arnold?. no same Arnold, just older... tell you secret they even got the original John Connor back. You have me sold already. Did the trailer show how they were going to continue from the original?. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together.. Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see?. We both like action movies :). Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ?. The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little.... Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one?. Yes, a similar one please :). I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead.. We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it?. okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray. Yes please :). Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties.. Of course :).

I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol. Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer?. I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL.

I am send you a trailer for the first one so you can make sure it's the one for you."], "retrieved_contexts": [". Hello. Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you?. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style?. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.. Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being. Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.. The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play.. I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.. ", ". Hello, how are you doing? Have you seen any good movie trailers lately?. No I haven't. Do you have any to recommend?. Have you seen the new trailer for Star Wars The Rise of the Skywalkers?. No, Im not a fan of Star Wars.. What kind of movies do you normally like to watch? Action, horror, family?. Action, Comedies, Romance. Have you seen the new trailer for Zombie Land Double Tap movie?. Yeah I don't really like zombies. I feel it, what about aliens? I know Men in Black International came out not to long ago.. Not really of fan of aliens either. Nothing about space, zombies, dinosaurs.. Gotcha, have you seen the trailer for Booksmart?. No I haven't. What is it about?. You haven't?

I think I am going to give watching it a try, I know I feel like that sometimes.

OMG I love Superbad. I do too! Oh if you're into that kind of humor you really got to check out Good Boys if you haven't already seen it!. Never heard of it. Its got that same kind of vibe going on, kind of hard to explain but if you ever get the chance try checking out the trailer. Yeah I think I will. ", ". Hi there!

Yes, Chris Rock, Owen Wilson, Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell, Steve Martin. I'm sure there are others also lol.. Haha, those are some classic funny guys. One more question then I think I have some recommendations. You watching with any kids or just adult comedies?. Just adult comedies.. One I have enjoyed with Will Farrell is The Other Guys. Hilarious cop comedy with him and Mark Wahlberg.. Yes, I love that one! It's very funny.. It is! I assume you have already seen Step Brother as well. Have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?.

I'm over watching Tangled and Zootopia over and over. Haha I can only imagine! (Also a strong recommendation for when the kids aren't around is Knives Out. It's my top movie for the year.)

What was the last movie you watched and how did you like it?. The last movie I watched was Avengers Endgame, I liked it a lot especially the climax at the end. Good choice! And how did you like Chris Evans in his role as Captain America?. I though Chris did well as a poster child for the all american hero displaying both courage and a moral compass that guides him. I was glad to see he got to wield Thor's hammer.. I agree I thought that part of the movie was exciting. I wish he would have been able to defeat Thanos with Thor's hammer. What movie genres peek your interest?. It was a nice combination to give Captain America a more offensive capability vs the very defensive shield. A movie genre that would peak my interest would be horror also.. Do prefer horror movies with drama or suspense?. suspense would be preferred?.

Sure why not, looks interesting to me too. But maybe check out the Dirty Dancing remake?. Maybe, I wonder if you can actually re-make a classic like that. Will it be the same without Patrick??!!. Probably wont be as good, the remake is never AS good. But could provide some entertainment. That is what movies are all about, entertainment. If I am not entertained I will fall asleep. I think I will try the new Dirty Dancing and see what I think. I do like comparing movies against one another when they are remakes or movies made from books. HA me too! I think the books is always better though. Nothing like seeing things with your own imagination. I agree, I love reading and have yet to see a movie that I liked better than the book..

I'm looking for a movie recommendation, something to get my mind off of the current status of our country. I love comedies and since laughter is the best medicine, I'd like to find a family friendly comedy to lift my spirits.. Sure, have you seen Inside Out or CoCo? The creators have made another movie coming out soon.. No, I haven't seen either one. Any actors I would recognize in Inside Out?. Inside Out is an animated movie by Disney, It's definitely family friendly, not really a comedy. That sounds like an excellent recommendation! Thank you! Hope you have a nice weekend, goodbye :). Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind are among the cast. Amy Poehler is a hoot!. I really like the movie, very easy to relate. Definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward.. Is CoCo animated as well?. Yes, it is.. Would you say their are morals/lessons learned targeted towards children in one or both of these?. I would say so. In my opinion, Inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. The key is to have good communication with people you trust. Coco shows the importance of family and tradition.. I personally feel that it is very important that children know that it's okay to 'feel' different ways. I'm leaning towards watching Inside Out first. What year was that released?. I agree. It was released in 2015. Would you happen to know if either of these films are currently offered on Netflix?. Inside Out is not on Netflix, but you can find it on Youtube, GooglePlay, and Amazon Prime for $3, same for Coco. Wonderful! I have an Amazon Prime account. Are these movies both rated G?. They are both rated PG. I thank you again for your recommendations and taking the time to answer my questions. I plan to accept your recommendations and watch both with the family this weekend..

I really like action fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings and Marvel movies. What do you like most about Marvel. I like superhero backstories. Sometimes it's fun to see how an ordinary person can become extraordinary, and how they cope with having super powers and the responsibility to protect people but still try to live a regular life. I like how Marvel can tell an in depth story based off dozens of comic books in 2 hours.. I was hoping you'd say that! Think about how crazy it must be to try and live a normal life when you have superpowers. Have you seen Avengers: Endgame?. I have seen it. It was amazing. But also really depressing.. I am in absolute agreement. Would you rewatch it again?. I would probably watch it as part of a marathon because I couldn't watch it on its own, but yes I would watch it again.. Would you be interested in watching Ant-Man?. I have seen it and I enjoyed it. Could you recommend an older Marvel comics movie?. I sure can! How about the Original Adventures of Captain Marvel, it was produced in 1941.. Wow, that looks interesting. I think I would like to watch that. Thanks for the recommendation.. Hmm, what do you find the most interesting about this one?. Definitely the fact that it's a 12 part movie series. I will look into watching it.. Hopefully, that will satisfy you Marvel craving for a while!. It should for sure tide me over until the MCU releases more movies. lol. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi. Have you any recommendations of a movie with a good plot?. I watch a ton of movies. Are there certain type of movie genre you prefer or do you like to watch anything?. I like films with beautiful scenery and in-depth plots.. Nice!! I just watched a new movie with nice scenery but it was a comedy. I like some comedies, if they have a good script and an in-depth plot, but mainly I like more realistic storylines inmovies.. Have you watch Us? The plot is great but not very realistic but it keeps you wondering even at the very end. No, I haven't seen that. It sounds like I'd like it.. Its a directed by Jordan Peel. He's an amazing comedian but he makes great movies.. Yeah, I like him a lot. Is the photography good in that movie?. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. What kind of movies are you interested in?. I like movies that have a good storyline,. Which movies have you seen recently that you really enjoyed with a great story behind it?. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the Irishman had good storylines. I was personally impressed by Charlie Says, have you seen this movie? Its interesting how things play out. I have not heard of this film. Who is in it and what is it generally about?. Matt Smith playing as Charles Manson, directed by Mary Harron. Its showing how certain a certain group of people that would do killings for Charles Manson and how they continued to pretty much worship him as their cult leader believing that their crimes were part of a cosmic plan until one day a member decides to make a change.. That sounds interesting. I think I need to take a break from Charlie Manson. Do you have any other recommendations?. My family and I really enjoyed The Hateful Eight starring Kurt Russel as a bounty hunter and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) they end up encountering another bounty hunter and a man that claims to be a sheriff. They end up being stuck in a blizzard and as they try to find shelter they encounter a couple other people and soon realize that getting to their destination might not happen. Everything that they encounter and go through keeps you on edge and interested to see whats going to happen next.. Yes, I agree that was a good movie. I thought everyone did a good job acting, but I have seen it already. Maybe one more recommendation? I like comedies as well as dark comedies.. Who is one of your favorite actors?. Joaquin Phoenix. He really is a great actor. Which of his movies did you enjoy the most?. I enjoyed Signs the most probably. Her was also good..

Hello, I enjoy Sci-fi and true crime documentaries. What would you recommend ?. I was honestly really impressed with Uncut Gems. Its a crime/mystery about a NYC jeweller who has a serious gambling problem.. Sounds interesting.I will give it a try. Thanks for the recommendation !. Adam Sandler has done a great job in this movie playing as a jeweler. He is neck deep in debt and people are always after him trying to get their money back but my boy Adam Sandler spends more money on gambling risking his life along with his family's future. Very tense movie man, keeps you on the edge the whole time. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. What year was it made?. end of 2019, there was this big fuss about how it got snubbed for oscar. Do you have any recommendations for space movies?. ", ". Hello, how are you doing today?. I'm just fine thanks for asking. That's good, how can I help you today? What is your movie preference?. I like anything with action, drama, or adventure. Know of any movies that fit into these genres?. Actually, yes! I know lots of movies with this criteria. Give me an example of your favorite movie that meets these requirements.. Fast and Furious Movies, 300, 13 Hours: Soldiers of Benghazi, John Wick, etc. Okay, that gives me a good idea of what you are looking for. John Wick was a great movie. Now if you could tell me an example of a movie that you didn't like or care for?. I really didn't care for Blade Runner, it was too dull. Some of the new Star Wars movies are a bit complex for my taste. I want something that's mindless and can take me out of the real world for a while.. That gives me a great idea of what your taste is... Have you been to the movie theater lately?. It's been a month or two. Did you see all the Marvell Avengers? If so already, tell me how you feel about terminator.. I have seen the Avengers. Not so interested in Terminator. Have you seen the preview to the new bad boys movie coming out next month?. No i haven't, is it good?. It might be a little comedic for you taste, but it should be a good movie. But I think you should definitely check out Bloodshot. Have you heard of it? I really think it's up your alley.. I have not heard of it, what is it about?. First of all it has Vin Diesel... he plays a soldier and something happens to him.... I'm intrigued, are the ratings good?. I'm going to say it looks good. It gets released in February. I'm not sure if your looking for a future movie or one that is already out.. I've always got an eye out for good movies coming up. I would love to watch the trailer.. Okay, I'll send it over to you. It has some Sci-Fi, but I really think you'll enjoy it. You seem like have a taste for war movies.. I always enjoy a good action/war flick. Go ahead and send it over. Thank you for the recommendation. No problem. Would you be interested in another recommendation? I'll also send over the new Bad Boys movie.. That sounds great. Thank you.. ", ". Hello there...how you doing today?. I am doing very well, how are you?. Better then I deserve...so movies huh. Yes, I like action movies, have you seen any lately that are good?. You bet...I am a fan of Marvel aka Superheros...you?.

My recent was Jumanji (not Marvel) & has a ton of action/adventure - was fun.. oh yes, I love the Rock and Kevin Hart, they make marvelous movies.. Me too...great chemistry there ;) alright it was nice chatting - my best wishes. Thank you, I accept your recommendation. You as well.. Bye now...Go Movies!. Yes, I love movies!.

Yeah, did you see in MI: Fallout he broke his ankle and kept going? That is dedication!. Yeah and the motor cycle chase in all his MI movies. (I am sorry I forgot to click the trailer).

Not sure if you are actually sending a link to Lady Bird, but now I am eager to watch it again as there are so many in the cast that I really like.

Yah I liked that one too. Us was pretty wild as well.. Yeah, but I like Lupita too much to think of her as the evil monster that she was at the end lol.. I totally get that.

I like comedies, both American and International. I also like some spy or mystery films.. Sounds awesome, I do like spy movies too to be honest. What's the last movie you watched?. I started watching Traitors on Netflix, which was produced by BBC 4. It's about a women working as a spy and trying to find a communist mole in the UK right after WW2. Well I think you would love the movie Snowden, it has actually been on Netflix before. It is about Edward Snowden an ex-CIA agent who showed the United States all of the vasts amounts of information they have on their citizens. You would love it! Check out the trailer.. Okay, sure I will check it out. Have you seen the movie 1917? The cinematography is supposed to be great.. No, but I have a couple of friends who went to go see it in the movies and said it was phenomenal! I should check it out if you're recommending it too, I will as a matter of fact.. Snowden is no longer on Netflix. Can you recommend another film to me? Comedy or spy film?. The Exception is another great movie, it IS on Netflix! It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm.. Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film Oh Lucy with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films.. I love those types of films! Funny thing is I'm super interested in Japanese culture, I find it so fascinating and some of the game shows they have on their TV are HILARIOUS!

Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. im looking for an action movie. I love action movies. I recently watched Fallen Angel. It is a great action movie.. what is it about. It is about a secret service agent who takes his job of protecting the president very seriously. It is the 3rd sequel but you don't have to have seen the first two to watch this movie. Of course, as with most movies, there is a conflict for the agent and he has to do whatever it takes to protect the president. There is a LOT of action that I think you would like. I highly recommend it!. what about a really gory action movie. I would say this is fairly gory as a lot of people get blown up and there is a lot of hand to hand combat with stabbings and lots of shooting. Would you like to watch this movie trailer?. no i want a horror movie. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. I was thinking more action without the horror. How about Chainsaw Massacre? There is a lot of gore in that movie and it is very scary.. but arent there several which one would you recommend. Diary of the Dead is good gory horror movie you might like. It's definitely a thriller.. whats it about. Some young adults, film students, are filming a horror movie of their own but as an exciting twist, they encounter real-life zombies.. whats a good family comedy. A great family comedy is. is what. RV. Another one is any of the Home Alone series since it is around the holidays and kids love these movies.. whats the plot of rb. Well, first off it stars Robin Williams who is the father of a family of 4. He is frustrated that his children don't seem to be interested in spending quality family time due to technology so he rents an RV to travel across the country and camp. Many hilarious obstacles occur. It's great for the whole family. Would you like to watch that trailer?. yes i would. ", ". Hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer.. Hello.

Carroll Shelby and British car driver Ken Miles are fighting the big wigs at Ford trying to convince them that they could build a race car to beat Ferrari.. Sounds cool, i watched a documentary on the event awhile back. Are the lead actors good? This might be something im interested in.. Matt Damon and Christain Bale. Both awesome actors. Well worth watching. I highly recommend it.. What others movie would you recommend?. I loved the Martian with Matt Damon. It's older but definitely worth watching.. Oh yeah, it was very good.

Hello.. Good morning!. Can I help you find a movie today?. Yes, that would be great! I am looking for a comedy.. Okay, what was the last movie you watched?. The last movie I watched was Knives Out, which was a comedic thriller. It was great!. Okay, do you prefer to see a comedic thriller, or just any comedy in general?. Great question, I think at this time I'd like just a comedy.. Thanks for that. Is there a specific actor/actress you'd like to see?. Not particularly, but I love any actor or actress from Saturday Night Live.. How about one with Will Ferrell? He was very popular on SNL.. YES! He is one of the best!:). I'd like to recommend Holmes & Watson. It's relatively new, from last year, and features Will Ferrell and also John C. Reilly.. I haven't even heard about this movie before. Do you have a brief synopsis?. Sure thing, it's a kind of satirical take on the story about Sherlock Holmes. Are you familiar with Sherlock Holmes?. Yes, of course! So, if this is a Sherlock Holmes like film, my guess this is more of a Comedic Mystery? Is that accurate?. Yes it's a comedy/crime/mystery film!. Love it! I accept this recommendation. I am going to go find where I can watch it. Thank you!. ", ". Hello! Can I help recommend a movie trailer for you?. I would love for you to find me an action movie. Okay! Do you like real world action, like war movies? Or do you prefer fantasy type action?. i prefer war movie. Have you heard of Dunkirk? Its a war movie about the Allies retreat from France during World War II.. No, i have not heard of that. Its an interesting film. It follows three different story lines to tell its history. I personally like the fighter pilots story.. Wow, i will definitely try that out. Tom Hardy is the pilot. Do you know him? He played Bane in the Dark Knight Rises and is the lead in Venom.. Yes i know Tom Hardy. Yeah, I think hes a great actor. This movie also won 3 oscars, if that helps!. Yeah it does help. Also, I just realized Christopher Nolan directed it. He also directed the Dark Knight movies. So, if you like the action in those movie, Im sure youd like Dunkirk.. great i will check them out. Awesome, the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes are great, too, in case you rely on reviews for movies.. i will definitely check them out. ", ". Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie to watch! What kinds of movies do you usually like?. Sounds great. I'm most interested in romantic comedies.. Those are great, what is your favorite?. I love Bridesmaids, because it's hilarious.. I've seen that one, that is a really funny movie. Do you like Kristen Wiig in any of her other movies?. To be honest, I'm not really familiar with her other movies. But she was really funny in Bridesmaids. I liked the scene where she's attending her friend's wedding dress fitting because it really made me laugh. It felt like I could really relate.. That's awesome; what was the last romantic comedy you saw?. Hmm, I have to think about that. I remember seeing Always Be My Maybe recently. I really liked that movie because the main actor and actress were Asian American like me. I felt like it was one of the few breakout movies for Asian actors.. That's good to know, is that something you'd like to see more of in movies?. Yes, I am very interested in seeing more diverse casts and more casts with Asian Americans specifically. We are usually completely absent from the big screen. So I am looking for a recommendation for a romantic comedy movie with Asian American characters.. I think you'd probably like this movie, it features two Asian American leads and is a romantic comedy that is supposed to be pretty good.. Which movie are you referring to?. Oops, I thought you could see it. I'm talking about Always Be My Maybe, it is a Netflix movie featuring Ali Wong and Randall Park.. I'd like another recommendation, since I just told you that I've seen that movie recently. Oh, sorry about that. I will pick something else. I'm assuming you've seen Crazy Rich Asians since it was so popular. Have you seen the Big Sick?. I haven't. That doesn't have Asian characters but I've heard good things about the Big Sick.

I can't get enough.. I've heard great things about that series. I have not seen too many action movies recently. What do you like? Can you recommend any movies?. I like comedies and drama as well as animated movies. I would definitely recommend the Lion King that was released this year. The soundtrack was wonderful and i loved the graphics. I saw the original but have not seen the remake yet. I would love to watch it however as I hear it is quite good. Thank you for the recommendation.. I would also recommend assassin's creed.

Was there anything bad about the movie? Did it end well?. reviews were mixed but it did win a few awards. How about the x-men: apocalypse movie?. That I did see. Again, Michael fassbender. I am a comic fan first, so it was a bit odd, but a movie I enjoyed.. Have you seen the most recent Joker movie? I think this would be a great movie for you to check out.. I have. It was technically a comic book movie, but the whole untrustworthy narrator plot took away some of it. I had no idea at the end if it was real or not. Plus, I doubt it will tie into any other movies.. ", ". Hello! I hear that you are looking for movie recommendations! What kind of movies do you like?.

A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!. I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.. Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dread in horror. Can you explain to me what The Transfiguration is about?. The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster.

Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. Great! Thanks for your help.. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. I am in the mood for a high action movie..

That's a good movie! Do you want to watch something similar to that?. Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind?. So you enjoy realistic movies? If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary?. Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's?. Yes, I do! I like documentaries that focus around mysteries. Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows. That's probably why! Do you like true crime?. Totally like them! Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it. I don't like movies which are violent. Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies?. I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies?. I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster.. I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that?. OOOO im totally afraid of that one. It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself?. How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these?. They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites?. I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that?. I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy?.

It's set in the past, not in today's modern world. And the prison was a tough system. Corrupt cops and all.. Morgan Freeman is an excellent actor.

How are you doing today?. I'm wonderful today. I just finished watching a movie with my kids.. What was the movie about? I've been looking for some movie recommendations.. It was a popular children's movie. What type of movies do you like?. I usually prefer action movies or Science fiction. Anything based on superheroes or similar.. It sounds like you have a diverse genre of movies you like. Nothing boring, lol. Have you seen a lot of recent movies?. The most recent movie I have seen is Bright burn. For recent movies that have been released. I typically enjoy anything action. I don't enjoy romance movies and I'm picky about comedies lol. If you have any recommendations I would greatly appreciate them.. Have you seen Pacific Rim? It's a few years older. It's about aliens and the humans that protect the planet against them. I know you said you like action, superheros, and sci-fi and this movie ticks all three.. No I haven't seen that movie. I know of it but I haven't seen it yet! If it checks all three of those I will definitely look into it. Thank you for your help and recommendation.. You're welcome. I hope you enjoy it.. I hope so too. I've heard it has great reviews.

For instance, I really enjoyed the first Saw movie but then they got kind of ridiculous.. What is the last horror movie you watched recently?. The Orphanage. That's a good one. What was your favorite part of the movie?. I liked the twist ending, how he was left in the closet all along. I enjoy surprises like that (kind of like Saw at the end).. The Saw series are one of my favorites, to be honest. I always like surpise endings.. I also really liked The Descent and the sequel.. I have found a movie. I think you would really enjoy watching Bird Box. Okay, I actually saw a trailer and it looked interesting and I would like to watch it so I'll accept that..

One day, Min-hyuk, a friend of Ki-woo's and a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to promise wealth to whoever possesses it.. ooo that sounds intresting i think i might really like that! i know how it feels to struggle to make ends meet..

Are you looking for a movie trailer to watch?. Yes, I am. What type of movies do you like?. I myself am really interested in war movies and comedies! How about you?. I like comedies, both American and International. I also like some spy or mystery films.. Sounds awesome, I do like spy movies too to be honest. What's the last movie you watched?. I started watching Traitors on Netflix, which was produced by BBC 4. It's about a women working as a spy and trying to find a communist mole in the UK right after WW2. Well I think you would love the movie Snowden, it has actually been on Netflix before. It is about Edward Snowden an ex-CIA agent who showed the United States all of the vasts amounts of information they have on their citizens. You would love it! Check out the trailer.. Okay, sure I will check it out. Have you seen the movie 1917? The cinematography is supposed to be great.. No, but I have a couple of friends who went to go see it in the movies and said it was phenomenal! I should check it out if you're recommending it too, I will as a matter of fact.. Snowden is no longer on Netflix. Can you recommend another film to me? Comedy or spy film?. The Exception is another great movie, it IS on Netflix! It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm.. Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film Oh Lucy with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films.. I love those types of films! Funny thing is I'm super interested in Japanese culture, I find it so fascinating and some of the game shows they have on their TV are HILARIOUS! Haha, thank you for that recommendation!. Do you watch Terrace House, the TV show?. No, but I heard is was a Japanese reality show of some sort. Can you explain it to me?. It's like the 1990s' Real World that was on MTV but it is like a slow drama reality show with good audio and celebrity Japanese hosts who make funny commentaries. It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of The Exception. I will check it out.. Yes I am going to watch it tonight, it sounds really amazing. I'd love to see what it's about first hand! Another movie I recommend is Murder Mystery with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, it is mystery and comedy all in one, I know you like that! It's about a New York cop and his wife who go on vacation and get framed for the murder of an elderly billionaire. You'd love that too!. I saw Murder Mystery, and I enjoyed it. It was a light movie. I liked the European locations and the mystery. What is one of your favorite war movies?. Saving Private Ryan is one hundred percent my top war movie of all time. Super realistic, and Tom Hanks was FANTASTIC! Action and emotion filled.. Cool. Well it was nice chatting with you. I'll check out The Exception.. ", ". Hi there! I hear you're a big fan of movies. I am! My husband and I enjoy watching together - usually action-based. Inside that genre, we're pretty open though - thriller, comedy, sci-fi - we enjoy most movies that move fast and keep us on our toes.. Awesome! Action movies are my favorite genre as well. What was the last action movie you saw in theaters?. Super hero something...I don't quite recall. We usually watch at home since we have a son on the spectrum and a huge TV to accommodate our movie enjoyment.. Yeah I know what you mean. Getting out to the movies is tough with kids. Have you seen the new Bad Boys movie with Will Smith?. No. I enjoyed the first one though. It should be entertaining. I like most of Will Smith's work.. If you liked the first one, I would definitely recommend watching the new one. I think it was as good as the first and better than the second. Fast paced action and, of course, lots of explosions.. Of course - lol! What do you think of the new Black Widow movie coming out? I know my hubby is really looking forward to that one!. ", ".

So like an inspirational biography of sorts? Have you seen A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood yet? It stars Tom Hanks and I absolutely adored it. I definitely think that Mr. Rogers is someone who made the world a better place.. No I havent seen that movie but it sounds interesting, The last movie I have seen was Hacksaw Ridge. It was a true story about a man for fought without a weapon I believe during Vietnam. It was a great movie I would recommend seeing.. Nice! I have not heard of it before; I have to add it to my list--I am not super familiar with the wartime genre. However, my friend and I watched Letters from Iwo Jima together a couple of years ago. It's a World War II film, but it portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of two Japanese soldiers. It is in Japanese (I am a native English speaker) so be forewarned you may have to watch it with subtitles!. Cool. Thank you for the recommendation. I will have to watch that movie. Hopefully you will take my recommendation also. Thank you.. You are welcome! I'll definitely check out Hacksaw Ridge--it sounds like something my dad and I can watch together!. Thank you are. Take care.. You too! Enjoy the recommendation!. I will. Same too.. Do you like the trailer? I forgot to mention that its also critically acclaimed.. Yes. You will like the Trailer for Hacksaw Ridge.. Good! There's also a companion film called Flags of Our Fathers which was film at the same time.. I will have to check out that movie also. Hacksaw Ridge was also up for Oscar.. Cool! It might make me seem a bit elitist but I do like to go for movies that have good reviews (most of the time).. Ok. Glad we agree on each others recommendations. Thanks again. Take care. ", ".

Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?. My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard.. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.. The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated?. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.. Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions?. Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore. I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train.. Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise. That sounds cool. What is that about?. It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him. It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists. Definitely sounds cool. I will definitely take a look. Sounds great! You've got two great movies to check out is there any other movie genre you want recommendations on? Or any movie you really like and want to watch something similar?. I would love to see a remake or something similar to Notting Hill. Julia Roberts fan as well.. I love movies like that! The first thing that comes to mind is Maid in Manhattan have you seen that before? it's not Julia Roberts but its a pretty similar storyline. I have seen it, Jennifer Lopez is awesome too. Critics do not give her enough credit. What is that new movie coming out of hers? The one where she is a stripper?. ", ". hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. Awesome! I was wanting to go out and watch a movie!. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. I want to be able to go out with a group of friends, so maybe a comedy or an action movie.. would you like to see A Rainy Day in New York. I don't think it's a good fit, no. A little less rom-com. Maybe something a bit more like the movie Tag in which it's mostly comedy with a bit of action peppered in?. Alright, wil you like to see 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'. What is that about?. this is best movie when you are in desperate need of a good belly laugh.. Well... That sounds like it could be a winner then. I think that'll be the movie I go see then! Thank you!!. Got it. Though, I do have a couple more questions about the movie, if you don't mind. Is the movie plot heavy or is it mostly just for laughs?. you will see your favorite Jay Baruchel and F. Murray Abraham. You know what they stands for.. Those are the actors, yes. Is the movie any good?. ", ". Hi How are you doing today? I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hi! Great I was going to ask about a movie trailer!.

If so what was it that seemed to have you intrigued?. It was really good! The story line wasn't your traditional horror flick. It was sort of predictable but it still had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The story flowed really well and it didn't have a lot of dull moments, which often happens in horror movies..

Preferably, I would like to not know to not be able to guess the plot from the trailer. Just enough to see if the idea is interesting or not.. Yes, that makes sense! What was the last movie you watched that you enjoyed?. I recently watched Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse and really enjoyed it!. Oh, nice! What was your favorite thing about the movie?. Honestly, I think it was just how stylish everything was. You could really tell a lot of love was put into it.. That's a great observation. Have you seen the Star Wars movies?. Many years ago, yes! I saw the original six growing up, but the new ones didn't interest me too much.

Krampus and Christmas Nightmare are some of my favorites.A nightmare before Christmas is a solid Disney classic if you have never seen it.

I love the cast and it's definitely a good thriller that keeps your heart racing for a majority.. What was your experience with Follow?. I saw it a few years ago back when it first came out and watch it every December. I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect.. If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies .. Oh hands down! I believe it's on Amazon Prime now, but I still watch on the original DVD like a movie nerd lol. Enjoy!. I prefer original DVD's rather than streaming or downloadable mediums..

Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you?. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style?. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.. Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being. Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.. The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play.. I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.. You are welcome. An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these.. Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.. I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones!. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. Hi I'm looking for a great SCI FI Action movie. hmmm what's one of your favorite sci fi movies you've watched?. Pacific rim. What did you like about it, the characters, the story lines, what stood out to you?. The characters, actors, and story line was really enjoyable. The special effects were great as well.. I agree, I really loved the ending to Pacific Rim. The characters were great. Are you familiar with the direct Guillermo Del Toro?. Yes I am, he does some good movies.

I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary.. Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?. My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard.. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious.. The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated?. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites.. Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2?. My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions?. Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore. I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train.. Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise. That sounds cool. What is that about?. It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him. It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists. Definitely sounds cool. I will definitely take a look.

Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer?. Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already.. It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best.. Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as Hitchcock-ian?. I will do my best to find something you haven't seen!. Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film!.

Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about?. It's one of my favorites he's done so far. James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film.. 23 personalities! That sounds interesting. Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film? He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a bad guy before.. He's *mostly* the bad guy. The film is about a group of girls that are abducted and held hostage by a person with multiple personalities. One personality in particular - The Beast - has a plan for them. Some of the personalities side with The Beast, and some do not. It is the second film in the Unbreakable series, but different in style for sure. You don't need to know anything about Unbreakable to see Split, though.. Wow! That sounds like a psychological mind twist and definitely vintage Shyamalan. I will accept the recommendation and give it a watch! It sounds like it's right up my alley and deals more with dread and suspense. Thank you kindly!. ", ". Hi. Nice to be talking to you.. Hi there!

I just watched Knives Out last night and thought it was really good! I like movies that aren't predictable and have a combination of comedy and action.. ", ". Hi how is your day. Hey there! It's been pretty good. I've been looking for something interesting to watch lately.. What kind of things do you like to watch.. I tend to lean more towards horror movies but I have a guilty pleasure for romantic comedy, too.. I love to watch horror movies myself! What is the last move that you have seen?. It's been awhile since I've watched a good horror movie. I think the last one that I watched was probably IT and I tend to watch the Scream movies over and over again. I like good horror movies that make you think, have good characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.. Those are the best kinds of movies when you are on the edge of your seat. I love that penny wise smile, nothing will ever compare to it. Have you ever seen any of the Insidious series?. I don't think that I have! Are they any good? What are they about?. They are one of my favorite scary movies. They all follow a different person every movie but it is about someone being taken into a different dimension of the world they live in.. That sounds like it perfectly describes a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just my kind of movie! I'd love to give them a try and start watching as soon as I can. Thanks for the recommendation!. They are a little bit of an older movie but I really enjoy them and will watch them over and over.. They sound like a perfect recommendation for me!. The movie has had 8 wins and 15 nominations for awards.. How do you feel about the acting in the movie? Is it cheesy or do they do a nice job?. They did a very nice job acting and selecting the actors and actresses for the movie.. Okay, awesome. I think you had me at being taking into different dimensions I love this suggestion. Thank you!. To be more accurate it is called The Farther and it really makes you think about if it could happen in reality or not.. How many movies are in the series?. There are 4 movies with the first movie coming out in 2010 and the most recent coming out in 2018.. Okay that sounds perfect. It gives me plenty of movies to go ahead and watch.. Yes, and you will be able to watch them over and over to understand them a little better.. Sounds great. Thank you so much!. ", ". hello there i hear you are looking for an interesting movie trailer. Yes this is correct!!!. There are many great actors out there and a personal favorite of mine is leonardo dicaprio. What are your thoughts on him?. He is a great actor. Do you have any movies lately by him?. I most recently watched Catch me if you can. it was an amazing movie. very interesting that it was based on a true story. What is that movie about?. to quickly sum it up. dicaprio is playing a character who basically impersonates a bunch of different careers and ends up forging bank notes and illegally making money. he can outsmart anyone in order to be successful. Who else is starring in this movie?. theres lots of talented actors and actresses. tom hanks, amy adams, christopher walken. just to name a few. Wow!! That's a lot of talented actors in one movie. I accept your recommendation. Thanks!!!. I'm happy to hear you accept the recommendation. I hope you enjoy Catch me if you can as much as i did!. Thank you so much. Do you who who directed thi movie by any chance?. steven speilberg!. He is a very good director. One of the best in the business.. now you will have another movie to add to your list of his all time classics!. You're right. Do you know which genre does this movie fall in?.

Hello, how are you doing today?. Hello, I am doing well. How about you?. I'm doing great. Happy Thanksgiving! Are you interested in watching a movie trailer today?. Happy Thanksgiving to you too. Yes, I'm interested.. Great, what kind of movies do you like?. Action Suspense of the thriller kind.. Great. What was a recent movie you watched of that genre that you liked?. It was an older movie. It was called Frailty.. What did you like about that movie?. It kept you guessing as to whether the person he said he was was really that character. Or did he do a switch.. Awesome, that sounds really cool. Have you ever seen the movie Inception? I think you might like that, it has a lot of action and is suspensful, and you are trying to figure out what is going on most of hte time. Yes, I did see that. In fact I had to see it twice to make sure I was thinking correctly about the movie. Did you see that one?. Yes I did, I really liked it. What about the movie Snowpiercer?. Yes, I also saw that one and liked it as well.. Cool. Seems like we have similar tastes in movies! Have you seen the trailer for Jojo Rabbit?. It does sound like it. No, I haven't seen that trailer for that movie.. Great! Its definitely suspensful, I saw it the other date. Would you like to watch it?. Yes I would!. ", ". Hi, how can I help you?. Yes, i was looking for movie recommendations, do you have any?. Yes, what was the last movie that you saw? My personal favorite is La La Land, because it is both a drama and comedy.. The last movie i saw was Geronimo, i enjoyed it because of the action and drama. What is La La Land about?. La La Land is about Ryan Gosling playing a struggling jazz musician who falls in love with Emma Stone who's a barista aspiring to become an actress. It's a musical as well, so there's a lot of singing.. I see, sounds interesting, but for me i enjoy movies more centered around action, do you have any reccomendations. Yes, Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best action movie I've seen thus far. You cannot go wrong with Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane and chasing after bad guys.. Wow, i definitely find that interesting, what is the plot about? How is Tom Cruise's acting in that movie compared to others?. Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol. Fallout is interesting because it shows Tom Cruise as an older man who is still trying to keep up with the action of chasing bad guys.. That sound's like a fantastic movie, i will definitely will check it out sometime! Thank you very much for that recommendation!. No problem. Hope you enjoy it!.

Would you like me to tell you more.", "Awesome thanks so much that sounds great!"], "retrieved_contexts": [". Hi! Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in?. I normally love comedies.. Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing?. I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though.. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies?. That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres?. I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan?. I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy.. Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team!. I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it.. Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler!. That does sound pretty perfect!. I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy.. I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha!. Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself.. I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;). Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it.. Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie?. The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it. Its moving and touching in all the right ways!. Well that sounds like a dream. Can you tell me a little about the plot? I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself.. Of course! I suppose using today's standards, it would be considered a dramedy (drama comedy) and is traces the life of Midler's character who teamed up with Caan's character, Eddie Sparks, who was a famous entertainer. He thinks he needs something to help bolster his act so he enlists the help of Dixie Leonard, Midler's character. They primarily get together to train US Troops during the war.. Wait a minute. They're entertainers but they train the military?. Oh gosh. I'm sorry, not train, entertain....my goodness. Please forgive my mind!. HAHA! It's totally okay. I was like What qualifies showman to train the military?! Haha! So Bette Midler has some singing in it?. Yes! I know its not a popular stance, but I adore her voice. Its so soulful!. I love it too! That's definitely a selling point for me! This movie sounds absolutely perfect. I can't believe I've never heard of it. I will definitely have to check it out!. Well hopefully the trailer sells you completely. Though I'm sure you'll love it!. Should I watch the trailer first?. I always encourage people to watch trailers because there can always be that one thing that they can see in the trailer that can make them excited to see it or hesitant. Either way, I'd rather walk into something with somewhat of an idea of what I'm walking into.. You're right! Should I watch now or watch it before we end this chat, just in case...?. ", ". Hi there.. Hi! I am looking for a movie recommendation. Perhaps you know of a good trailer I could watch?. Yes, I can help. What is the last movie you have seen in the movie thearter.. The last movie that I saw in the theater was Frozen 2 with my daughter. But I am looking for something to watch on my own. I really enjoy historical fiction.. For the historical fiction do you like a violent or more of a story focused movie.. I can tolerate some violent, but I like human interest stories more.. Me too! What time period or era do you like the most.. I really enjoy anything from about the 1600's to now.. Are you looking for a newer movie or an older released movie.. Either one is fine with me.. Have you very heard of the move Outlander. No, I have not.. ", ". Hello, I hope you are doing well. What kind of movies are you interested in?. Hello! I am well, thank you. I hope you are as well. I LOVE zombie movies, even cheesy ones. I also like stoner comedies.. I also love stoner comedies! I think my favorite recently would have to be The Interview with James Franco and Seth Rogan. Oh! I've seen advertisements for that one, but forgot all about it. Is it available for streaming yet I wonder? I love Seth Rogan in everything he does! Pineapple Express was great!. It is! It is streaming on Amazon Prime Video. It has so much of the classic Seth Rogan humor in it and adds a light hearted take on the whole North Korean situation. It is definitely a watch over and over again movie. I've seen it four times!. This is a perfect recommendation. I'm going to put it on right now! Thank you so much for a great movie recommendation!. No Problem! I hope you enjoy!. Thanks! I am excited to see how it is. I like James Franco a lot, too. But I've only seen him in more serious roles.. I was the same way, but I feel like after this movie he should really move into more comedic roles. He was outstanding. But you could truly see the friendship that him and Seth have on and off the camera. They played off of each other very well. That's awesome to hear. I'm pulling it up right now. I'm ready to settle in with some laughs for a while.. Oh you will definitely laugh throughout the movie. It is so hilarious!. That's good. I need it after the last movie I watched. The - Report. OMG, it was so boring!. Oh I completely agree that movie was not very interesting got me at all. I just cannot get into the drama movies. I am more of a Comedy/Horror movie person. It sounds like we have similar taste in movies. A fun zombie movie is Fido. I'm not sure if you've seen it, but it's comedy and zombie. I love it!. I have not, I will definitely have to check that out as well!. I think you will enjoy it,. It's light hearted and funny.. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["Watch it at your leisure!

I'm here to help you pick the perfect movie!. Hi! Awesome, thanks! I just saw the new movie A Day in the Neighborhood and didn't like it that much. It was a little too slow for my liking. I would love to see a new movie in theaters that is really engaging.. ok! Why was it too slow? Did you like the actors in it though? How was Tom Hanks?. yes it was, Tom Hanks played the part great though. I just liked him better in other movies. ok... do you prefer action , movies? There are some good ones coming out in theaters very soon. yes I do. Are you familiar with the Kingsmen Series?. no I am not. think James Bond John Wick style with a bit of humor as well. Oh I think I would like that!. So I would point you to the original one... that came out in 2014 Kingsman: The Secret Service and if you like maybe watch the sequel and then head to theaters early next year to see the third. ok I accept!.

I think the new <movie> movie will be pretty awesome. I was pretty impressed with the last one"], "retrieved_contexts": [". Hello. Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you?. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style?. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me.. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s.. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion.. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing.. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw.. Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being. Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work.. The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play.. I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too.. You are welcome. An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these.. Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings.. I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones!. If you are ever curious what became of Oscar Wilde there is a 2018 movie, THE HAPPY PRINCE that explains what became of him. Subsequently, explaining why we haven't heard from him after a certain period of time.. That sounds quite interesting too, I will do some research on that now. That was another movie type I forgot to mention liking, autobiography I guess it would be called? telling the story of someones life works and such. Yes...Oscar Wilde is an interesting character to learn about. Don't forget to have tea and pastries for your movie night. A good idea with a Victorian themed movie date. HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT....good night. Thank you again for the wonderful suggestions, I researched The Happy Prince and will definitely look into watching that as well, and what a wonderful idea setting up some tea and pastries for movie night snacks, bravo! I accept your recommendations, you have a goodnight too. Thanks again!. ", ". Hello I am looking for a movie trailer to decide if I want to see the movie. Can you assist?. Actually I was looking for a movie. Can you assist me by any chance?. will do my best..do you like tom hanks?. I like Tom Hanks a lot.. What was the last movie of his did you see?.

I have that movie on to must watch list. Have you watched it?. not yet I'm waiting for the right time to watch I'm available lol.

I havent seen it. I lost interest after the last one Paul Walker was in :(. i know its very sad losing paul walker in the middle of still filming the 6th part but i still want to know how it will all ends thats why I'm still interested. Haha...fair enough.. lol. Are you a Dwayne Johnson fan?. oh yea i watched all his movies and i even knew him way before he starts to film movies i knew him he was in WWF. Same here! It's pretty cool watching his transition from wrestler to full on movie actor. its amazing but the being in the field of acting really matches him lot better.

Oh yes I would take that recommendation!. ", ". Hi, how ya doing today?. Im good what's up!. Not too much. Just finished watching a movie. What was the last movie you watched?. Watched this Korean film: Train to Busan. You've seen it?. No, I haven't heard of it. Are foreign films your favorite genre or are you into other stuff as well?. Yeah. Right now into some Korean films though any Korean action films would be great to know!. Action, huh?. yeah I think any action move would be great. I'm an action fan too. How long ya been a fan?.

I liked that the movie featured people of color, not just that, how it also featured an overweight woman. I liked that there was a triumph at the end for the movie's protagonist.. Oh yeah, I enjoy movies like that too.. Nice, yeah. The movie kind of addressed some issues that I have been thinking about on my down time as well. What kind of movies do you like?. Pretty much the same as you. Have you ever seen Goldengirl?. No, I have not.. It came out in 1979, a doctor tries to make a superwoman out of his daughter. Does that sound like something you would enjoy?. It sounds scary. I might not like it. Not many old films are worth watching, and I have not heard of this before today.. How about starship troopers 2: Hero of the federation? It came out in 2004. It is an action packed Sci-Fi film. That might be good. Does it have good reviews? Is there a Starship Troopers 1?.

I like really good sci fi movies, but I do not like action movies.. Did you see Martian?. No, I did not. I don't really like Matt Damon very much.. I know its better if you like the actors in it This isn't sci-fi, but did you see Bohemian Rhapsody? I really liked that film.. I did see it! I also thought it was very good. In addition to sci fi I also enjoy biographies and history.. We just saw Ford verses Ferrari. That was awsome!. I've never heard of that movie, can you tell me more about it?. Ford wanted to make a sports car in order to be competitive with other car companies.. I didn't know that! What actors and actresses are in the film?. Matt Damon and Christian Bale. We saw it at an IMax. My husband is a sports fan. I didn't think I would like it, but I am so glad I went.. That sounds like something that I would like! Thank you for the recommendation!. You are so welcome. You won't be sorry!. Do you have any other recommendations for movies that don't have Matt Damon?. I also saw JUDY. It was ok It's a little about her biography.. Is that the one with Renee Zellweger?. Yes it is. You might enjoy that one.. Do you know if she does her own singing in the film or do they dub Judy Garland's voice in?. ", ". ", ". Hello. Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me?. Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc.... I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama.. Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about.. It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining.. I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it.. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL. I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again!. No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split.. I just watched Split recently! I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers.. That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for Unbreakable. Honestly, I'm glad Split came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now.. That's so true. I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days. But sometimes, I think movies like Star Wars rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan..

Hello. hi. How are you? Would you like a movie recommendation?. That would be great. What genre of movies do you like to watch?. romance, I've thought of a movie now that I have said that. One of my favorite movie is The Notebook. The Notebook is a classic! Can't go wrong with Ryan Gosling!. Right, I love the whole story. I've watched it over and over and my feelings are always the same. I love that fact that he is patient with her from beginning to the end. Persistent!. I think I've got a good recommendation for you. What's the latest romance movies you've seen?. Latest, I went and saw Queen and Slim.. I think you will love A Walk to Remember. I haven't saw that particular movie but I am now interested. I definitely accept.. I'll give you some info. follows the rite of passage of a jaded, aimless high school senior (Shane West) who falls in love with a guileless young woman (Mandy Moore) he and his friends once scorned. The two develop a powerful and inspirational relationship in which they discover truths that take most people a lifetime to learn.. So they were me to her to begin with?. It is also by Nicholas Sparks, the author of the Notebook so I think you will very much enjoy this.. Well thanks for the recommendation. I hope I can say that you were right.. You are welcome. Enjoy this movie! Another classic is Love, Actually. I've seen Love Actually but it doesn't give me the same feeling however its comical but not my cup of tea.. ", ". Hi! What kind of movie can I help you find today?. I like rom coms. Do you prefer classic movies or are you looking for something new?. something new. My girlfriends and I loved Crazy Rich Asians. Would you be interested in that film?. I've seen it. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is also fantastic but it's also more of a romantic drama.. That sounds interesting thank you.. thank you! and for a good rom com night you can never ever go wrong with the 80's movies like when harry met sally Happy watching!. Oh I really like that one thanks for reminding me of it.. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. That's great. I have been wanting some recommendations.. ohh cool, which type of movies you like most????. I like documentaries.. then you may try about geographical documentries about valcano.

I like indie and coming of age stories. I'm also always down for a good horror film.. Have you seen the film Us? Got some interesting family dynamics, which is also important in all of the good coming of age films, etc. Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie vibe, etc. Think you might like it!. Yes I did see it! I thought Lupita Nyongo's performance was amazing. And definitely agree about the family dynamics part.. Got it. Nice! The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a psychological thriller kind of way... Ever seen Pi by Darren Aronofsky?. No I haven't! But I love psychological thrillers, what's that one about?. Seen ANY Aronofsky films? They all have some thematic similarities. Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly.. yes! I've seen Black Swan and Mother! Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling. I definitely suggest Pi then. It's a little more claustrophobic than Black Swan, but in a way that suits the obsession theme well.. it sounds so good. I definitely am interested in that and accept that recommendation. ", ".

Earlier this Month, its a documentary that walks through the highly publicized trial of Michelle Carter, on trial for encouraging her long-distance boyfriend over text messages to kill himself. oh wow sounds intriguing. Where can I find it?. On HBO Now and HBO Go. ok great Ill have to check it out. Any big actors/actresses in it?. Not really its not a docudrama style film. ah ok.

Then we definetely have something in common. The latest movie I seen was Bad Boys. What about you?. Me too, I love Will Smith. what did you like about it?. Yes! I know this might sound weird, but I really loved that they were able to make one last movie, being as though the others came out years ago. But I did find that it was extremely funny, and surprising that there was a son that was unknown on there. What did you like about it?. I like the fact that it manages to transcend its hoariest tropes.. Lol! Exactly. What movie would you recommend me to see?. ", ". hi, how are you?. Hi, how are you? I'm curious to hear if you have a recommendation for a movie.. sure i have some movies to recommend for you. I just need to know your preferences.. The last great movie I watched was Midsommar. I'm a huge fan of Alamo Drafthouse Movie Parties because often times the plots and themes seemingly have all been done before.. oh I see. do you like action or horror movies?. Truthfully I am a documentary fan. Just a splash of sci-fi or horror. Midsommar to be was more of a really unusual acid trip (lol!) than a horror IMO.. lol i can recommend some documentaries. what kind do you like to watch?. History. Pirates. Tales of the ocean/boating/island life.. ok. i have a movie to recommend. how about pirates of the carribbean.. I've seen all of those and the one with Keith Richards was my favorite.. ok. do you want me to recommend that or something else.. I'm comfortable with that recommendation as I haven't watched those in several years and it would be fun to re-visit them.. ok. i will recommend one of those movies. how is pirates of the carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl. That's great. Thank you!. your welcome i just recommended it.. Is there any other similar movie you can think of off the top of your head?.

I'm always looking for new things to watch. Are there any other movies you would suggest?. Goon on Netflix is a low-budget comedy movie about a hockey player.

I have! I recently watched Never Back Down. It came out in 2008. Have you ever watched it?. Unfortunately, I haven't watched that movie. What about the movie Parasite that recently won an Oscar?. I have! I've heard about it from a friend and decided to watch it. I never heard about it before because it wasn't a mainstream film.. Great! What did you like and not like about the movie?. One thing I liked about the movie was that it tackled present day topics such as class confliction, inequality within society, and wealth disparity. I don't really dislike anything about the movie at all. It's a solid film.\\. Great, would you like to watch a similar movie, Joker?. I will definitely check it out!. I'm happy you're interested, you won't be disappointed!. How do you like Joker compared to Parasite? Do you have a favorite between the two?. I liked them both a lot.

Do you tend to gravitate towards the newer movies or older movies. i like both it don't matter old or new for me it all depends on the story how it will interest me. oh cool. who's your favorite actor/actress. i like fast and furious all of them i can't wait to watch the final hobbs&shaw. I havent seen it. I lost interest after the last one Paul Walker was in :(. i know its very sad losing paul walker in the middle of still filming the 6th part but i still want to know how it will all ends thats why I'm still interested. Haha...fair enough.. lol. Are you a Dwayne Johnson fan?. oh yea i watched all his movies and i even knew him way before he starts to film movies i knew him he was in WWF. Same here! It's pretty cool watching his transition from wrestler to full on movie actor. its amazing but the being in the field of acting really matches him lot better. oh yeah for sure. I think the new Jumanji movie will be pretty awesome. I was pretty impressed with the last one. yap so true. his body amaze me for his age. No kidding! I thought you're supposed to get smaller with age, that guy just bulks up more and more. oh yeah. I just rewatched one of his older movies the other day and he looks like a baby compared to now. amazing changes but fits him perfect even better. ", ". Hi! See any movies lately?. HI!!

What kind of movies are you interested in?. I like animated movies a lot, sort of like what your kids might watch! Do you ever take them to see animated ones?. We do go to the movies a lot, and of course animated ones are their favorite. I think next up on our list might be Sonic The HedgeHog. Have you seen that one?. No, but I heard kids love it! They fixed Sonic's face, he use to be super scary to kids! Now he looks like the actual character!. Well thats good, haha! I think they will love it. I need a movie for my husband and I to go see, with no kids. Any good recommendations?. Really depends, are you looking for a date movie, or maybe more of just a night-on-the-town movie?. Well my husband isn't a fan of any sappy movies. He likes action/suspense movies. So maybe something along the lines would be great?. 1917 would be perfect then! It is one of the best suspenseful movies I've seen so far.. I havent heard of this one, what is it about?. It's about British Soldiers attempting to deliver a message about a German Attack in World War I. Very suspenseful, as you can probably tell.. Sounds interesting!! I am not much of a fan of war movies! I still would like to see something my husband would like as well as me, any other recommendations?. Do you like comedies? Jumanji 2 has a lot of comedy, and action! As well as A list actors!. We both like comedies as well!! We loved the first Jumanji! I think this one would be a great one to see!! Thanks!!. No problem!

I am here to try to find a movie trailer that you would like to view. Are you ready?. Hello! I am well, thanks! I am ready!. First off, what is your favorite kind of movie to watch - drama, action, comedy, etc?. I definitely don't care a lot for drama. I would say horror/thriller, action, and comedy are probably my favorite genres.. Those are my favorites too! Have you seen the latest Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise?. I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list.. I would have to agree with you on this. I think half of the movie was chase scenes of one sort or another.. It can be fun, but bot when it takes up most of the movie.. Have you seen any of the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise? While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot.. I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting.. You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child!. Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise?. The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it!. Thanks for that information. I am definitely interested in this and accept your recommendation.. ", ". Hi!. Hey!. What kind of movies do you prefer?. I like most movies, but I prefer romance and sci-fi.. What was the latest movie you've watched?. The latest movie I watched was Gladiator.. What did you like about it?. I really like the characters. I think the director did a good job of giving me a character to root for. I also really like the cinematography. It has some really beautiful images.. Would you like a movie recommendation closer to Gladiator? Perhaps directed by the same director?. That would be awesome. Ridley Scott is actually my favorite director so I enjoy most of his work.. Have you ever seen Hannibal?. No I haven't. Do you mind to tell me more about it?. It's directed by Ridley Scott and it is very well done in my opinion. It's about a very well respected Baltimore forensic psychiatrist who is also a cannibalistic serial killer. Once caught for his crimes, he agrees to help the FBI find other serial killers. Oooh, I like the sound of that. I really enjoy crime movies. Can I ask who is in it?. Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta. Oh my god, nice. I love Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. I will definitely accept and watch your recommendation. Do you have any more? Maybe just personal favorites of yours? With this whole quarantine thing, I really need things to watch.. I also definitely would watch Silence of the Lambs, it's a 1991 film starring Jodie Foster and it's part of the Hannibal series. It also has Anthony Hopkins in it as he plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter as well in this one. It's a very interesting set of films and will have you on the edge of your seat. I have seen that one, but I had no idea it was a series deal. I definitely have to watch Silence of the Lambs if I watch Hannibal. I will accept both of your recommendations. Thank you very much!

Hello! How're you today?. I'm doing fantastic!. Great! What was the last movie you watched?. Frozen 2 in theaters. Did you enjoy it? What was your favorite part?. It was definitely a great family film! My favorite part was when Krystoff was singing his solo part and it sounded like an 80's ballad. It was hilarious. Oh my goodness, that sounds like a really fun time! I really liked the first one, I haven't gotten around to seeing the second one yet! Was there anything you disliked?. I can't recall any parts that i disliked actually. You should check it out especially if you have small children.. How rare is that! I'll definitely have to check it out then! I'm a huge fan of Disney myself :). I'm easy to please when it comes to movies. I love Disney as well. We even have the new app and I've been binge watching all of the vault classics.\\. Oh gosh that's so awesome, I've been looking into getting that as well! Do you like any other genres? I'm a huge comedy fan myself.. I do in fact, Another movie I just watched was The Kitchen. Based off of three women who have husbands in Irish mafia. Such a great film also. Do you know of any other movies similar to that?. That sounds really good! If you like movies about women and crime, you might like Widows! It's set in contemporary Chicago. Four women are left with their husband's massive debt after they all mysteriously die from criminal activities. They have to take matters into their own hands and do things on their own terms! Would you be interested in that?. Yes! That sounds really good! Thank you! I accept your recommendation!. I really like a lot of different crime movies like that and women empowerment!. I love a movie with a strong female lead for sure. Any other recommendations?. Hmm, I would say that the movie Hustlers may also interest you! It depicts a band of women that scheme and trick Wall Street men out of money! It has a lot of big name stars including J-Lo, Lizzo, Cardi B and Lili Reinhart!. Oh wow, Cardi B in a movie haha! I'll check that one out too!. I know, right? It also has KeKe Palmer and Julia Stiles as well. But based upon your interest in The Kitchen, I think Widows might be the most similar!

It looks like they went and cast a lot of the original cast in it, plus a lot of returning characters. They really take advantage of the Time Travel plot. When does it come out?. I'm not sure that the date has been announced yet but Google says next year, planned for summer.. Ok. I will except your recommendation.

That's the vampire movie, right? Do you want to stick with lighthearted vampire fun, or just cheesy fantasy in general?. Yeah, it's like a mockumentary about vampires, it's hilarious. Cheesy fantasy works for me, or anything with Taika Waititi, honestly.. Have you seen Jojo Rabbit yet?. I haven't.. It's directed by Tika Waititi and is a comedy set in Nazi era Germany.. That sounds like a great recommendation. Thanks! I'll take a look.. I think you'll really like it. It got a 7.1 on IMDB and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes.. Have you heard whether it's funny or not?.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the Irishman had good storylines. I was personally impressed by Charlie Says, have you seen this movie? Its interesting how things play out. I have not heard of this film. Who is in it and what is it generally about?. Matt Smith playing as Charles Manson, directed by Mary Harron. Its showing how certain a certain group of people that would do killings for Charles Manson and how they continued to pretty much worship him as their cult leader believing that their crimes were part of a cosmic plan until one day a member decides to make a change.. That sounds interesting. I think I need to take a break from Charlie Manson. Do you have any other recommendations?. My family and I really enjoyed The Hateful Eight starring Kurt Russel as a bounty hunter and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) they end up encountering another bounty hunter and a man that claims to be a sheriff. They end up being stuck in a blizzard and as they try to find shelter they encounter a couple other people and soon realize that getting to their destination might not happen.

Its showing how certain a certain group of people that would do killings for Charles Manson and how they continued to pretty much worship him as their cult leader believing that their crimes were part of a cosmic plan until one day a member decides to make a change..

I have heard about the book. Haven't watched the movie. From details it looks very emotional. Does the movie have humor element?. It has a slight humor taste but nothing major. Is that what you look for when searching for a movie?. Slight humor works fine. Is it good to watch with kids?. I would say that it could be slightly emotional, but it is a great movie to watch with the family for sure. So many lessons taught and important ones too!. Ok. I accept this movie recommendation.. So would you like to watch the trailer?. Yes. before that do you have any other suggestion?. ", ". hello there! I am here to help you find a movie trailer. what is your favorite genre?.

Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes.

I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times.. okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre?. I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos. that sounds really good!. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind.. That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it.

Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies. Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character.. OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing!. Thank you for the compliment, but I'm no expert I just happened to notice it was him and when you mentioned the Dark Knight films I was like, Oh yeah I remember he directed that movie.. Haha, wierd. What are some other ones similar to memento that you like?. That's a tough one because it is a unique film, but going off of the genre you mentioned earlier, psychological drama, I think Identity is another good one where the main guy has schizophrenia and his personalities end up killing each other within his own head. It's quite a brain twister.. oh wow, that makes me think of that movie, A Beautiful Mind. Yes that one is also excellent, a classic Russell Crowe movie.. yeah, that one was also pretty sad. ", ".

What kind of movies do you enjoy watching?. I like watching fantasy/sci-fi, comedy and horror.. So in other words you're not very picky... even better.

I love watching zombie movies and this movie is quite different from other movies of this kind because it isn't dark.....it brings in comedy and is more fun. I like the actors too, they have great synergy with one another and makes it more enjoyable to watch. That's a creepy and definitely a good one! The actors in that one are good!

Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Do you have a movie recommendation?. Sure, what kind of movies do you enjoy?. I enjoy romantic comedies, action, and children's movies.. Pixar has a great selection of children's movies that also appeal to adults, are you familiar with Pixar?. Yes, that is from Disney right?. Disney owns them, but they do their own work. I highly recommend the movie Up. It's a heart warming journey with a little boy and his talking dog. They float their house with balloons and go on an adventure.. Is that the one with the older man as well?. Yes, very colorful and little sad at first but a fun journey. Would you prefer something less modern?. No I think that would be great. I haven't watched it because it looked sad, but I think I'll give it a try.. Hmm it seems that I can't recommend up at the moment, but here is a similar title called The BFG. I have seen that movie before. Is there anything else you can recommend?. Sure, going back to my animated recommendations Ratatouille is fantastic. About a mouse that wants to become a chef and moves to paris. That sounds interesting. Is it funny?. Very much so. It's has a 96/100 metacritic score and won an Oscar. Ok, perfect! Thank you!. So would you like to watch this movie trailer?. Yes please.. ", ". Hello how are you doing today?. I am well and you?. Glad to hear it. I am doing pretty good just surviving this storm we have going on with all this corona virus stuff lol. It actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies I have fallen behind on. I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch?. Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies.. I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all!. Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice!. Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer?. Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer.. Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J. Thanks again! Have a good one :). Hey I think I can actually send this trailer to you if you would like?. Actually that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. Thanks!. Of course. I am working on getting that over to you now or I can send you a link to the right one.. Okay thanks, I appreciate it as i'm not too savvy on the computer. Do you have a link by chance?. You got it! Also, What was the last thing you saw Will Smith in aside from this movie you are going to watch tonight?. Perfect, thanks! I would have to say the latest release of Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence. I can't remember if the name is Bad Boys 3 or a spinoff name like Bad Boys Reloaded - Also I wanted to see him in Gemini Man but never did. Have you heard how that movie is or seen it?. I have seen Gemini Man and I have to say maybe not his best work but was still entertaining for something lazy and entertaining. Also, I love the Bad Boys series lol. They remind me of my childhood.. Haha yes! Did you watch the Fresh Prince of Bel Air at all? I did as kid. Oh yea! That was my Jam. I am pretty sure on a yearly basis I go back and watch a few episodes so the theme song is forever stuck in my head... Aka: its happening right now...... lol I guess I have been following his work for a very very long time now.. Haha yeah I mean think he was only around 17, 18 when he started the show, possibly younger. And he's still in Hollywood! So we basically watched him grow up as we did. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you find a movie trailer.. yeah, I want a girl's night out with my best friend. What kind of movie do you recommend?. Well let's see. Do you girls prefer rom-com, mystery, horror? I know my BFF and I really enjoy a good horror movie from time to time.. I love horror movies too!! And so does she. Oh thats fantastic! May I ask, What is the last horror movie you enjoyed?. I cant remember the name of it. but it was about a couple that got married, and his family wanted to play hide and seek in this big mansion. I believe the movie you are referring to is Ready or Not. Considering the time of year, would you enjoy a Holiday Horror?. Yes, absolutely!!.

I really like high intensity and motivational movies.. Really? What are some of your favorite movies that you've seen?. Some of the movies I recently seen have been THE JOKER and UNCUT GEMS. The intensity was super high, almost giving me anxiety, but I still loved it.. I loved THE JOKER! Joaquin Phoenix is the man!. Right?! He did an excellent job. I was also really surprised by Adam Sandler's performance, he did a great job as well.. Have you ever heard of GOOD WILL HUNTING?. I actually haven't, care to explain a little bit more about it or who is in it?. It's about a man named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who has a gift for mathematics. He has had to endure some troubles in his life and he needs some guidance from a psychologist played by Robin Williams. Would you be interested in seeing the trailer?. Wow that actually sounds like a great movie! I'm an engineer myself so I feel like I would connect with Matt. I also dearly loved Robin Williams, so it will be nice to see him acting. Yes, would definitely be interested in watching the trailer.. Well that's good, I would highly recommend watching the trailer a little bit before taking the time to buy it just in case, lol. When you buy movies, where or how do you should buy them from?. I personally try to rent movies, it's cheaper, or I use a subscription service to watch my movies. What about you?. I used to rent them from a REDBOX which is outside of 7/11's and you can rent them for like $1, but I just pay a little bit more and rent them on my smart tv which is more convenient.. Yeah, I'm a college student who can't really afford a nice smart tv, so a laptop is all I generally use.. Don't worry, I was doing the same as well. All of my movie watching was on my laptop. The movie you just mentioned, is an older movie right?. That is correct, it came out in 1997.. Oh nice! I loved movies that came out in that era, the plots were so good.. ", ". Hello. I am here to recommend a movie thriller for you.. yes i'm watching thriller movie. May I know the kind of movie you like?. yes i'm unterstand. ", ". Hi there. How are you?. I'm doing well. I was wondering if you had any movie recommendations.. Let me see. Well, what kind of movies do you usually find yourself watching? What do you like?. I tend to like action movies that also involve comedy.. Oh, me too. So, what did you see last that you liked?. I really liked Avengers: Endgame because I liked the pacing and the effects were great.. Okay, I think I kind of understand your taste a little. It's sort of similar to mine, although I haven't seen an action hero movie in a while. Did you like Guardians of the Galaxy?. No, I haven't, but I heard good things about it.. Oh, I was assuming that you'd seen it. I saw that with my son and I was surprised at how much I liked it.. Were you able to see the sequel for it?. No, but I would like to. I would really recommend that. I don't know if you know who Chris Pratt is, but he's a keeper. He was on Parks & Rec, the comedy show.. I love Chris Pratt! I accept your recommendation. Thank you so much.. :) oh, I'm so happy. Cool. I hope you like it.. Do you have any other recommendations for action movies?.

Today I came to talk about your favorite movies as of recent times. What is your favorite movie that you've seen recently?. I just watched Ford v Ferrari last week and I really enjoyed it. Had good acting and I thought it was an interesting story.. That sounds like an interesting film! What genre would you categorize this movie as? Is i your favorite genre?. Its hard to categorize it, but I would say Action or History. It tells a real story in the movie and the story is entertaining and exciting. There is some action involved. I guess I like true stories about people who did things that were amazing and adventurous.. Oh, I see! So you like true stories, such as of historical figures of people who have accomplished notable things! I am trying to get the best picture of what makes you get on the edge of your seat when you watch.. Yeah they don't have to be war movies, but I do like those a lot as well.. And you mention war movies. Do you like the action aspect of war movies more, or the fact that it is real more? For example, do you also like action movies which are Marvel-based?. I do like Marvel movies as well. I haven't seen all of them but I watch Iron Man, and Captain America and liked those movies quite a bit. I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well.. I see. For you, I recommend Black Mass. This movie is a true biographical film which revolves around an alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob. This is also an action film.. I think I heard of that but I haven't seen it yet. Is that the movie that has Johnny Depp in it or an I thinking of the wrong movie?. That is correct! This movie has Johnny Depp and it is a true film telling of events which took place in the 1970's. You may like this movie if you end up watching it!. I think I really would. Its an interesting era to set the film in as well and I would like seeing the way they portray the 70's in the movie. I think I will watch that movie sounds like a good recommendation.. ", ". Hello! how are you? What type of movie do you like?. Hi there - I am a big fan of fantasy and horror, Stephen King, etc. Got any recommendations?. Cool! Have you seen The Shining? What about Stephen King's IT? If you are a fan of horror movies you will like these. Oh, I like the IT. I think I will accept that recommendation and check it out. Thanks so much :). Okay sounds good. We still have to talk back and forth for several more turns. So let me ask you. Have you seen the old version of It?. Oh, I did not realize. I actually did see the 1990 version (on TV). Which one do you think is better - new or old?. Well I think the new version is creepier in my opinion. But not sure the chapter II is that good.. Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot. I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it!. I definitely will check it out - are you a Stephen King fan?. Yes of course! I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie?. The Shining was solid. Obviously, the Jack Nicholson version was a classic. A favorite definitely. I also liked a little known TV film and book called Rose Red...underrated.. ", ". Hi. How is everything today?. Everything is going well, thanks! How are you?. I'm doing great today. Thanks. That is wonderful. I think it's a perfect day to see a good movie.. What genre of movies do you like?. I really enjoy movies with clever comedy (as opposed to cheap comedy), dramas, documentaries, and movies that make you think.. Do you have a favorite actor for this types of movies?. Kate Winslet is a personal favorite. I also love Meryl Streep.. I have a movie that I think you will like its called Divergent.. Oh that sounds very interesting. I'd love to hear more.. Its a movie in a futuristic world were Kate Winslet's character must decide which faction she wants to join in order to survive.. I do believe that would be a fascinating watch!. Yes it is.

Hello there! I am here to help recommend a movie trailer for you!. yes sure. ", ". Hello from across the miles. hello!. so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation?. thats correct! Can you help?. Of Course ! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like ? what genre if I may ask ?... I typically like action movie! bUt ones that make you think, not just ones with a lot of explosions. What was the last movie you watched ? either rented of went to the theatre.. I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that. Well I recently watched Call me by Your Name, and it was beautiful; both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning. May I tell you a little about it ?.. that doesnt really seem like its my style. well theres the Kevin Costner movie, Three days to Kill.. thats full of action, as he and his estranged daughter reconcile,, its quite thought provoking,, ;-). I have actually seen that one and I thought it was a little boring because it was more about killing time with his daughter. My favorite movie of all time is Jack Reacher. what about the new The Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford ? thats a great movie !. I think that looks interesting! Ill accept that recommendation!. Great ! The story follows Buck, a domestic dog who finds himself in the wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the late 1800s. Based on the 1903 Jack London book of the same name, the movie stars Harrison Ford as Bucks owner, John Thornton.. Sounds cool!!. Can you watch the trailer ? Let me know your thoughts ?. it looks really cool! I really want to see it. The CGI of the dog looks a little fake but otherwise the movie seems to have really cool scenary. I watched it with my best friend, and we kept talking how we relate to the friendship of the main character and the dog .. Yeah and I just recently got a dog so it will be a great movie to see. Plus Harrison is such a great actor. he really is! Such an epic voice. well you said you like action pics , so you can't get more action than this !. Exactly I am really excited to see it!. ", ". Hey. hay whats up. How are you, are you passionate about movies?. oh yeah, most definitely. What genre of movies is your favorite?. Animation, comedies, and Action adventures. And which comedy movie is your favorite?. i honestly cant think of one I like above others. Kung fu hustle is a good one that comes to mind. What did you like most about that movie?

I saw a trailer for Avator recently. A sci-fi fantasy genre that looked very interesting and beautiful special effects.. I remember you saying that The Rock, Jack Black are hilarious actors. They did a great job in both movies. The new Jumaji took the original story in a different direction from the original film, which is something I enjoyed and respect immensely. Would you like to see this trailer? Otherwise, we can discuss the incredible film Avator, which was directed by James Cameron. as you may know, he is a very accomplished director..

Most type of movies. Well not war movies or sports as much! A good comedy or love story sign me up!. Oh nice. So, what is your favorite comedy or love story?. One that keeps popping into mind is Central Intelligence! The Rock and Kevin Hart are my favorite!. Ok, so super goofy comedy. Do you like. Well if I laugh a lot it is a winner. I do not like immature humor though. What about you? What do you like in movies?. Sorry, I totally pressed the wrong button there. I was going to ask if you like SNL character type comedies.I do like movies. I see what you are saying. Not Bevis and Butthead. lol. Exactly! I do like SNL most of the time. I think it has gotten a bit boring. I enjoyed it more in my high school and college days. Do you like comedy or do you like the war movies haha?. I like most movies. If you like romantic comedies, I would like to throw out some of my favorites and see if you have seen them yet or not.. Sounds good to me!. Stranger than Fiction, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Pleasentville.They are good and mind bending, which I love.. Oh mind bending is great. I have seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I actually have that movie pop into my head occasionally. I definitely am going to put that on my to watch again list. I have not seen the other two.... Ok, Stranger than Fiction stars Will Ferrell. Short plot peek: An I.R.S. auditor suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death.. Interesting. Tell me about the other one!. It Stars Toby McGuire. He is in today and falls asleep or something and wakes up in the tv program he adores. He is dressed in 50's clothing and is in black and white. He helps the close minded people in this era see how things could really be if they just opened up.. Wait! I have seen that one! I am definitely taking your recommendations on Stranger than Fiction and rewatching Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind!. Thank you. I know the Stranger one sounds less exciting, but I like Will Ferrell in this one a bunch because it is unlike any of his other rolls. Just like Jim Cary in Eternal Sunshine. It is cool to see him in this different but still funny way. Do you think you would be interested in seeing the trailer?. I would thanks!. I hope you enjoy it. It was a pleasure to work with you.. You too thanks so much! do happen to have the trailer for the Jim Carey one? its been a long long time since I've seen that one!. ", ". Hello! How are you?. I am doing well, how are you?. I'm doing alright. What kind of movies do you like?. I like all kinds of movies. I am especially into syfi films but I like to watch everything.. Nice! I'm a avid horror watcher myself but I do enjoy some SciFi. What's the last movie you've watched that you've enjoyed?. I love horror movies too. I watch Doctor Sleep the other day.. Ooh. That's one I want to see. How was it? I finally watched the new Child's Play the other day, it made me laugh more than be scared. When it comes to SciFi, are you more Fifth Element, Aliens, Stranger Things or Star Trek?. It was good not a bad movie, but of course nothing in comparison to its original The Shining. But definitely a movie to check out. Fifth Element is awesome and I love Stranger Things. No so much of a Star Trek fan but Ive seen all the movies.. Right, The Shining was a staple thriller/horror. It was jst interesting to see how they brought that into Doctor Sleep. Fifth Element is my movie. I've been trying to keep up with Stranger Things but my the wee ones won't allow it. Star Trek and Star Wars aren't on my go to list but I will watch them if I have to.. OMG, you have to finish watching Stranger Things lol. A new trailer for season 4 just came out. I cant wait for the new season.. ", ". Hello, are you a big movie fan too? I really like movies. Yes I enjoy watching movies especially comediesand animation.. Animation and comedies are great, and nice for get-togethers. I saw Avengers: Endgame recently and really liked it and the CGI. It was dramatic and had a good payoff for their long-running story, esp Ironman. What about you?. I am looking for a good movieto make me smile. Any recommendations?. If you like comedies and animation then the Star Wars movie coming up with baby Yoda would be really nice. He's wonderful and amazing.. I never got into the Star Wars series. Any others?. You might enjoy Addams Family. Its always pretty funny. In another genre, the sequel to the Shining is coming out, its Doctor Sleep and its supposed to be good so I would recommend it.. Isn't the Shining a horror movie? I definitely do not do horror. I am a big baby!. Oh okay. Well you might like to check into Charlies Angels, it looks fun and its a comedy and light-hearted enough for the holidays. Hope you enjoy it!. That may be up my alley. I do like a good chick flick.. In terms of animation, there's a fantasy film that's out called White Snake, thats looking like a solid one... Hmmm I haven't heard of that. Do you know what it is about?Or maybe a holiday movie?. There's a holiday time movie that's animated, something like this?. Is that the name of it? Holiday Time?. First off there's Frozen II. Its an animated sequel to Disney's Frozen movie, really popular.. Yes I would love to see that. Great Idea! I accept that recommendation! Thank you!. Thanks! Enjoy your movie!. Thank you so much!. Of course. I really think you'll like it, and you might catch The Star, that was the other animated holiday film I was thinking of. Take care!. Happy Holidays!.

I'll watch them, but I probably don't like it haha. I stay away from horror movies no matter what. They make me jumpy! What was the last good movie you have seen?. Honestly, I really like the Joker. Not a lot of people understood it and I feel like it was because they were expecting the Dark Knight Joker, rather than the real Joker himself. What about you?. I have watched a lot of movies. Recently, my favorite was The Green Book. I thought it had such a good story of friendship. Do you like indie films at all?. I do, but I haven't seen as many as I would l like!

I will except your recommendation. I definitely can't wait for it to come out specially if it's better than the last.. It honestly looks really good.

Yeah I do. I do too, I think I'm going to give it a shot in 3D and see how good its become since it first came back..

Hello, I'm here to help recommend you a movie! How are you?. I'm great! How are you? I'm a huge fan of horror films - particularly those that deal more with dread than gore.. Oh man, I love horror movies! What have you seen recently that you liked?. The last horror film I saw and liked was A Quiet Place. Such a unique film that relied on silence!. I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different?. A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread!. I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving.. Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dread in horror. Can you explain to me what The Transfiguration is about?. The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster. You get to follow him through a snapshot of his story, and all of it is very dark.. That actually sounds like an intriguing and unique premise. Plus a fresh take on the vampire genre. Is it a newer film (like within the last 15 years)? Or older?. It came out in 2016 in the Cannes Film Festival from an Australian director. Haha, I had a Shudder account for a brief time and found it there while I was movie binging.. Was it well received at Cannes? I know just being accepted there tells me it should be a great movie!.

What do you like in movies?. Sorry, I totally pressed the wrong button there. I was going to ask if you like SNL character type comedies.I do like movies. I see what you are saying. Not Bevis and Butthead. lol. Exactly! I do like SNL most of the time. I think it has gotten a bit boring. I enjoyed it more in my high school and college days.

The trailers are really good, but it does help to be a fan and know about the last few movies. Make sure you catch it.. I think the only Daniel Craig James Bond that I've seen was casino royale. There was an older one I saw a very long time ago with a ski lodge? but the memory is very fuzzy. Which Daniel Craig Bond films should I see before I watch the latest one?. Well, I would suggest at least the last one, which is Spectre. What other type of movies do you enjoy?. A pretty wide variety if I'm being honest.

Hello from across the miles. hello!. so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation?. thats correct! Can you help?. Of Course ! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like ? what genre if I may ask ?... I typically like action movie! bUt ones that make you think, not just ones with a lot of explosions. What was the last movie you watched ? either rented of went to the theatre.. I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that. Well I recently watched Call me by Your Name, and it was beautiful; both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning. May I tell you a little about it ?.. that doesnt really seem like its my style. well theres the Kevin Costner movie, Three days to Kill.. thats full of action, as he and his estranged daughter reconcile,, its quite thought provoking,, ;-). I have actually seen that one and I thought it was a little boring because it was more about killing time with his daughter. My favorite movie of all time is Jack Reacher. what about the new The Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford ? thats a great movie !. I think that looks interesting! Ill accept that recommendation!. Great ! The story follows Buck, a domestic dog who finds himself in the wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the late 1800s. Based on the 1903 Jack London book of the same name, the movie stars Harrison Ford as Bucks owner, John Thornton.. Sounds cool!!. Can you watch the trailer ? Let me know your thoughts ?. it looks really cool! I really want to see it. The CGI of the dog looks a little fake but otherwise the movie seems to have really cool scenary. I watched it with my best friend, and we kept talking how we relate to the friendship of the main character and the dog .. Yeah and I just recently got a dog so it will be a great movie to see. ", ". Hello! How are you doing today?. Hello, I am doing good, what about you?. I'm doing well. This week seems to be flying by for me. I'm excited to be seeing a movie tonight, do you like to go to the movies?. Oh I like to go to movies and especially if there is my favorite genre movie. What movie preferences do you have?. There are several movie preferences. What was the latest movie that you watched?. The latest movie I watched was this new Charlie's Angels. Have you seen it?. I have seen that. A great action/adventure for sure! What did you like and dislike about the movie?. I like first of all how actors play, Elizabeth Banks, the director, created really good movie. I like that it is adventurous and fun to watch.. I completely agree with you. Would you like a movie that is a similar type of story or would you like a different one?. I would like to watch different one, more chick flick or romantic comedy, is there any movie you will recommend?. ", ". How are you. I am good, and you?. I am doing ok. With this COVID-19 everything is not the same. It is like a move LOL. Yes, lol. I am looking for a good movie to watch. And reccomendations?. well that will depend on you like. tell me few of the movies you liked in the past. I like pretty much all genres of movies. But comedy,drama and horror films are my favorite.. I like old movies. As far as comedy I would pick Police Academy old but very funny. On the drama side I would say The notebook. What is Police Academy about, I've never heard of in it. Any known actors?. I am not sure how old you are but Steve Guttenberg and Kim Cattral are in it. Move is about a group of misfits and how they join a Police Academy and it follows them in training and later in job as cops on the streets.. Yes, I am familiar with Kim Cattral. Sound like a great reccomendation! I will definitely watch! Thak you!!!. This had few movies but start with 1st one for sure. Can't wait to see it! Thanks. on the current day I would say Schitt's Creek. What is that about? Sounds pretty awkward lol. This is a show about a rich family that got rubbed by the accountant and they are forced to go live in a tiny town that they purchased as a joke. They live in a motel. But you have to hear them talk and follow the life in this town. I am watching this for a second time in a year and love every minute of it.. Oh wow, sound interesting!. You can find it on Netflix 1-5 seasons and 6th is on POPtv for now but I am sure it will be on Netflix soon. Searching now!.

It is a really interesting movie and Joaquin Phoenix rendition of the Joker is very captivating.. That's what I heard, I really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance of the joker before is Joaquin's performance comparable?. I think what makes both of them so good is that they are shown with very different characteristics and do it very well. In this movie with Joaquin we have an origin story that keeps your attention.. Thanks for your recommendation of the Joker. I'd like to see that movie.. Id like to offer you this trailer.. Thak you, I'd really like to see that movie now.. Very nice, I am glad I could help..

I can't get enough.. I've heard great things about that series. I have not seen too many action movies recently. What do you like? Can you recommend any movies?. I like comedies and drama as well as animated movies. I would definitely recommend the Lion King that was released this year. The soundtrack was wonderful and i loved the graphics. I saw the original but have not seen the remake yet. I would love to watch it however as I hear it is quite good. Thank you for the recommendation.. I would also recommend assassin's creed. I think this may be right down your alley. Video game movies are tough. I do like the Resident Evil movies, and Michael fassbender is an awesome actor. I will check this movie out as well. Was there anything bad about the movie? Did it end well?. reviews were mixed but it did win a few awards. How about the x-men: apocalypse movie?. That I did see. Again, Michael fassbender. I am a comic fan first, so it was a bit odd, but a movie I enjoyed.. Have you seen the most recent Joker movie? I think this would be a great movie for you to check out.. I have. It was technically a comic book movie, but the whole untrustworthy narrator plot took away some of it. I had no idea at the end if it was real or not. Plus, I doubt it will tie into any other movies.. I would recommend aquaman if you haven't already seen it. Jason Momoa is a great actor. I have seen this. It might be my favorite DC based movie. It was bright when it needed to be and had some character development.. ", ". Hi how are you?. I'm fine, how are you?. It's freezing where I am at, but I am snuggled up nice and warm..

The premise is that John Cusack finds a portal that leads him into the mind of movie star John Malkovich - who plays a dramatized version of himself.

You are most welcome. lol :) Do you like movies and if so which genre?. I love movies. Science fiction is probably my favorite, followed by action/drama or action/thriller.. which film have you seen recently? i love that genre also. It's probably not the last science fiction film I've seen, but the one that comes to mind first is Blade Runner 2049.. I love Blade Runner. Especially more older films. Despite it's faults, I really enjoy the original Blade Runner. It has a fantastic atmosphere. Yeah, they don't make movies like they used to.. If they had Keanu Reeves it would have been better. The ain actor ruined the film. Speaking of Keanu I loved Replicas.. Yeah, Keanu Reeves is great! What is Replicas? I don't think I know that one.. He is the main role it is similar to x-files and a mix of matrix. Cloning. i really like it and i think you would. you should check it out.. Sounds interesting. Is it a newer film?. 2018 byt anything this guy makes is really good. he is under rated in my opinion. he would have been awesome in the newer version of the shining rather than ewan mcgregor.. Never been a fan of Ewan McGregor to be honest. Cool, so pretty recent, surprised I never heard of it. Any other actors of note in Replicas?. me neither. a bunch of unknowns which makes it better and he tends to make those types of films anyhow. But John Ortiz has made some films for drama. Replicas sounds great, I feel like Keanu Reeves has been everywhere recently, but I only recall seeing the him in John Wick films as of late. I'd love to see the trailer for it and check it out.. awesome. no one would ever play john wick better than him btw. i wish they had him in deathwish rather than the other guy from die hard. Ha, I never watched the new Deathwish. I've seen some of the originals and even those were done to death by Charles Bronson. Would be great to see Hollywood embrace more original ideas instead of drudging up established IP's because of their noteriety.. i agree. everything is a remake. they are even trying to remake now Hitchcock's films. which we both know will ruin the films.. I recently found out they already redid Psycho a few years back, I was shocked.. yea that was not the same. back then they had great actors that didnt need technology to pull you into the film. have you seen the purge?. No, I haven't seen any of the Purge films. Going to check out Replicas though, thanks for the recommendation. Take care!. ", ". Hello, I hope you're having a good day today.. Hey! You as well, how's it going? Any good movie recommendations?. Well, are you into history at all?. Definitely! Depending on the type of movie, I more like action and comedy, but if it's like an uplifting history movie I can definitely be into it!. I love comedies also! And if you're into action movies, I highly recommend the John Wick series. It is just jammed packed with stuff happening for the first minute right now do the end.. Okay great! I've heard of those, do you like all of them in the series? There's three, right?. Yes, there are three. I admit, my favorite is the first one, as is the case with most movie series. However, there are so many great actors and the character development is engaging. I think, too, that most Keanu Reeves films have a certain level of comedy that keeps you coming back for more.. Cool! Thanks so much for the recommendation, I'll check those out, the first one will be on the top of my list. Thanks!. Remember, just nonstop action, no chance to lose your attention. I hope you enjoy them!. Thanks so much, I will!. John Wick. Any other good action movies you're excited about that are coming out soon?. Sorry about that, I put it in the wrong box. Ironically, I don't know when it is expected to release, but I heard they are planning to continue the Matrix series (also Keanu!). I heard about that too! Any idea who else is in it?. I heard that all but the actor that plays Agent Smith are planning to return. I loved him, but I am sure they'll figure something out. Enjoy your day!. That would be great! He's an awesome actor, thanks so much, enjoy your day too!. ", ". Hi, my name is Jackie. How are you today?. Hello! I would like a movie recommendation. Well, I would recommend Titanic. Have you ever seen it?. Yes I have, I dont like love stories. What kind of movies do you like? I like all kinds.. I like action and thriller. Okay. Do you like the Fast and Furious movies?. No, I do like movies like silence of the lamb!. Me too. It was a really good movie, I thought it was scary, but the story line was amazing.. Yes It was! Can I get a movie recommendation like that?.

Sounds awesome, I do like spy movies too to be honest. What's the last movie you watched?. I started watching Traitors on Netflix, which was produced by BBC 4. It's about a women working as a spy and trying to find a communist mole in the UK right after WW2. Well I think you would love the movie Snowden, it has actually been on Netflix before. It is about Edward Snowden an ex-CIA agent who showed the United States all of the vasts amounts of information they have on their citizens. You would love it! Check out the trailer.. Okay, sure I will check it out. Have you seen the movie 1917? The cinematography is supposed to be great.. No, but I have a couple of friends who went to go see it in the movies and said it was phenomenal! I should check it out if you're recommending it too, I will as a matter of fact.. Snowden is no longer on Netflix. Can you recommend another film to me? Comedy or spy film?. The Exception is another great movie, it IS on Netflix! It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm.. Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film Oh Lucy with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films.. I love those types of films! Funny thing is I'm super interested in Japanese culture, I find it so fascinating and some of the game shows they have on their TV are HILARIOUS! Haha, thank you for that recommendation!. Do you watch Terrace House, the TV show?. No, but I heard is was a Japanese reality show of some sort. Can you explain it to me?. It's like the 1990s' Real World that was on MTV but it is like a slow drama reality show with good audio and celebrity Japanese hosts who make funny commentaries. It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of The Exception. I will check it out..

It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character.

Hello, I am here to help you chose a movie. Great! I'm excited to hear what you may have picked out!. What kind of movies do you normally like to watch?. I love comedies and documentaries, personally. Comedies especially.. What was the last movie you watched? And do you normally watch movies online with something like Netflix/Hulu or do you prefer to watch in the movie theater?. I like watching both in theater and at home, but Netflix is usually where I watch movies. I recently had my friends watch This Is The End, since they hadn't seen it. I love that movie.. Do you want to watch something similar to that or something new?. Something similar, at least in the vein of being funny, but also ridiculous. I'm a fan of dumb comedies, to be honest. The dumber the better.. Have you seen any of the Austin Powers movies?. I've seen the first two, and part of the third, which I thought sucked, sadly. The first one is a classic.. What about Johnny English? Its been a couple of years since I've watched it but I remember it being similar to Austin Powers in the line of dumb spy comedy.. I've never heard of it, but it sounds intriguing. Tell me more :). It's got the guy from Mr. Bean in it. Basically he's a mess of an agent because the directors of the agency never really intended for him to become an agent.. I love Rowan Atkinson! I love Mr. Bean! I am definitely interested in this now. I love his chaotic but innocent energy.. Good! I didn't realize it wouldn't let me send more than one message at a time and I was going to send you a trailer. Mr. Bean is the total embodiment of chaotic energy.. Awesome. Thank you so much! This definitely looks right up my alley. Do you know if it's available for streaming?. It was on netflix a little while ago but I think it might have been taken off. If it is gone its probably on Youtube.. Okay, thanks. I'll be on the look-out for it. If not, I can always IMDB Rowan Atkinson, lol.. ", ". Good evening! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer!. Awesome! Thank you. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see?. I would like to see some trailers for upcoming horror movies.. I love horror movies! One of my favorites is The Shining and I really enjoyed the recent prequel, Dr. Sleep. What are some of your favorites?. I like Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween. Awesome Jamie Lee Curtis plays a great role! Are you looking for something similar?. Yes. I like Jamie Lee Curtis in the new Halloween, so I'd like to see something similar to that. Okay great! Any other horror movie preferences?. I like it when the villain is articulate like in Hellraiser. That was a great scene!. It was. SO I would like to see more of that. Would you be interested in an upcoming movie about a mysterious creature escapes from it confine and begins wreaking havoc on a small town?. Yes I would. I would recommend Antlers - it will be released this year!. Awesome. I like that reccomendation. Great. It was produced by Guillermo Del Toro. Have you enjoyed any other movies produced by him?. I have. I accept your reccomendation. ", ". Hi how is your day. Hey there! It's been pretty good. I've been looking for something interesting to watch lately..

So please recommend on that line?. ", ". Good morning!. Hello!. So what sort of movies are you into? What sort of trailers do you like?. Well, since it is the holiday season I love watching Christmas movies. I know the ones on Netflix are not considered good movies but they are fun and I enjoy laughing at and with them.. Hm, there's a few new ones for this year that look like they might be funny. Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable! There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny!. Oh I don't know if I heard of that one? What is it about? I watched Klaus the other day and it was actually really good like I can see it becoming a Christmas classic.. It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually. Or is supposed to, if he was good at it! So I think it will have a lot of silly moments.. Oh that definetely seems like something I would enjoy! Thanks for the recommendation - I accept it! Sounds kinda similar to what I watched last night, which was about Santa's daughter and how she wanted to go to college and not take over the family business.. That sounds funny too! I hope you enjoy it! Getting into the Christmas spirit!. Yes I am!. I have another suggestion from, an older one that is just as silly as the newer one, called Bad Santa, have you seen that one?. I have not seen that one. It's a decent one, wacky adventures, a guy pretending to be santa and all the things that go with that. It's not as wholesome, but sometimes that's what makes it fun.. hmmm I will consider it, could be funny but I think I do prefer wholesome.. Hm, alright, what about Christmas Angel. Hmm I think I saw the trailer to that and it seemed too cheesy or bad acting. ", ". Hi there, I hear you're looking for a movie?. Hi, you heard right!. What was the latest movie that you saw and liked?. I watched Us recently and I liked that a lot. Us is a great movie! Do you like horror movies in general?. It depends - I don't like horror movies that are just gore or things jumping out, but I like movies that are suspenseful and keep you guessing. Have you seen any Ari Aster movies? They're pretty scary and suspenseful.. I've never heard of them - what are some of their movies?. Midsommer and Hereditary, one is about a couple going to Sweden and finding a cult, and one is about a family haunted by demons.. Oh okay! I've seen Hereditary and I've heard about Midsommer but I wasn't sure if I would like it - it seemed to get mixed reviews. It's weird but visually really beautiful and worth watching.. okay cool I'll maybe check it out! Do you have any other recommendations? I also like documentaries. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a really cute and fun documentary about a man who has a famous sushi restaurant. What kind of subjects do you like for documentaries?. I usually like things that are more political or about something surprising - I recently watched Tell Me Who I Am and Fahrenheit 11/9 and I liked both of those, though I thought 11/9 was pretty biased.

Hey there, I'm Mike and I'm here to help you you find a movie trailer. Cool, thanks Mike. FYI i don't like gory movies. Well, that takes one genre out of the way. :D Are you looking for something on the other side of the slide? Maybe a romcom or comedy?. I forgot to mention I also don't like romcom's but I do like to laugh.. Yeah, romcoms aren't high on my list either, but since I watch *a lot of movies, I dip my toe in every once in a while. Since laughter is the best medicine, what kind of comedy do you prefer? Maybe letting me know what you watched last will give me an idea. The last comedy I watched was Blockers. But I do like a good zombie movie as well.. Kinda hard not to like anything that Seth Rogen touches, that guy has a direct line to my funny bone. So, a fellow zombie fan as well...how about a combination of the two??. Seth Rogen is pretty funny LoL. I would love a combo movie! What you got?. I'm going to reach back to one of my go to recommendations to see if you've seen it...Fido. I have not but I'm intrigued...is it similar to shaun of the dead?. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Great! I really love all kinds of movies. My favorites are war movies based on true stories such as American Sniper, We Were Soldiers, or Hacksaw Ridge. I am not opposed to other genres. Other favorites include comedy or medical dramas. Not the biggest fan on Horror.. Do you want a movie with similar stories or different ones?. Good question. Lets do similar today.:). I was really impressed with the trailer for the movie 1917 which is in theaters now. Have you heard of this movie?. I have not heard of this one.. There are two well known actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth. Looks like they play really good roles in this movie.. Sounds great. I will accept this recommendation!. I too am a war movie fan, this movie is based on World War I. I would also enjoy this movie. Thank you for accepting my recommendation..

Always enjoy those type of films.. Me too - the best one I've seen is in a movie called Remember. Remember? Never seen that, who is in that one?. Christopher Plummer - he's amazing!.

Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie to watch! What kinds of movies do you usually like?. Sounds great. I'm most interested in romantic comedies.. Those are great, what is your favorite?. I love Bridesmaids, because it's hilarious.. I've seen that one, that is a really funny movie. Do you like Kristen Wiig in any of her other movies?. To be honest, I'm not really familiar with her other movies. But she was really funny in Bridesmaids. I liked the scene where she's attending her friend's wedding dress fitting because it really made me laugh. It felt like I could really relate.. That's awesome; what was the last romantic comedy you saw?. Hmm, I have to think about that. I remember seeing Always Be My Maybe recently. I really liked that movie because the main actor and actress were Asian American like me. I felt like it was one of the few breakout movies for Asian actors.. That's good to know, is that something you'd like to see more of in movies?. Yes, I am very interested in seeing more diverse casts and more casts with Asian Americans specifically. We are usually completely absent from the big screen. So I am looking for a recommendation for a romantic comedy movie with Asian American characters.. I think you'd probably like this movie, it features two Asian American leads and is a romantic comedy that is supposed to be pretty good.. Which movie are you referring to?. Oops, I thought you could see it. I'm talking about Always Be My Maybe, it is a Netflix movie featuring Ali Wong and Randall Park.. I'd like another recommendation, since I just told you that I've seen that movie recently. Oh, sorry about that. I will pick something else. I'm assuming you've seen Crazy Rich Asians since it was so popular. Have you seen the Big Sick?. I haven't. That doesn't have Asian characters but I've heard good things about the Big Sick. I accept this recommendation.. ", ". Hello, I am here to help you find a good movie to watch!. Awesome. I like horror movies about ghosts, spirits, evil entities. Awesome! That definitely gives me an idea of movies to recommend. Do you know what the last move you watched was?. the last annabelle movies. Did you like it? What do you like and dislike in horror movies?. i loved it!!. Good! I prefer the horror movies that are less boo and more suspenseful rather than jumpy. What about you?. i completely agree!! There are some movies where the acting is just that bad. haha.. ", ". Hello! What type of movies do you like best?. Comedy movies are my favorite. They can break up drama in a movie that would otherwise be uninteresting.. Cool! What are your favorites you've seen?. Some of my favorites have been Mr and Mrs Smith, The Boundy Hunter, and The Proposal. They can be dramatic or action packed stories but have comedy to break up the tension. I am looking for a recommendation.. You like action and comedy together.. Yes. Action and comedy or occasionally Romance and comedies.. I liked Mr. and Mrs. Smith a lot too when it came out! It was really fun to watch.. I agree. It was fun with good acting and chemistry between the characters, it had lots of action scenes like the van chase, and it had plenty of comedy throughout all the conversations.. What's your least favorite genre of movies?. I dislike country western movies or movies with an old timey feel. It exists before my time so maybe that is why I can't get into it but movies like the Lone Ranger were totally terrible..

Hi, my name is Drake! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer.. Hello!. What kind of movies are you most interested in?. I really like action fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings and Marvel movies. What do you like most about Marvel. I like superhero backstories. Sometimes it's fun to see how an ordinary person can become extraordinary, and how they cope with having super powers and the responsibility to protect people but still try to live a regular life. I like how Marvel can tell an in depth story based off dozens of comic books in 2 hours.. I was hoping you'd say that! Think about how crazy it must be to try and live a normal life when you have superpowers. Have you seen Avengers: Endgame?. I have seen it. It was amazing. But also really depressing.. I am in absolute agreement. Would you rewatch it again?. I would probably watch it as part of a marathon because I couldn't watch it on its own, but yes I would watch it again.. Would you be interested in watching Ant-Man?. I have seen it and I enjoyed it. Could you recommend an older Marvel comics movie?. I sure can! How about the Original Adventures of Captain Marvel, it was produced in 1941.. Wow, that looks interesting. I think I would like to watch that. Thanks for the recommendation.. ", ". Hello there!

I don't have a favorite necessarily. please give me a moment to have a look at what we can recommend you. Thank you for your patience. No problem. I understand.. Have you seen Erin Brockvich with Julia Roberts?. Yes, that's a good one. I'm looking for something a little more current.. Have you considered the live action movie Mulan?. That sounds like a great idea. Is it good for young kids?. Yes it's a Disney film adaption of their animated movie.. Wonderful. I'd love to see it. Thank you so much for your recommendation!. One moment while I get the trailer up for you.. I can't wait to see it.. Alright it should be right up now.. This looks like a great movie to take my family to see with me.

That sounds good. My husband gets bored and falls asleep if the movie isn't funny or exciting.. There is a upcoming movie called The Love birds, which is a romantic comedy. with Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani. What else is Kumail Nanjiani in? I know the name. He's been in the big stick, Hot tub time machine 2, Men in black international.. Okay. When is the movie out in theaters?. Hmm sadly after rechecking it's going to DVD, I am sorry.

There are all kinds of things out right now- what kind of movies do you like to see? Are there any genres that you don't like?. Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad. I don't like a lot of violence and language. I guess I'm in the mood for a feel good movie. Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting.. I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking!

Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho.. Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie.

No, what is it about?. It is a classic formula of two people from different worlds finding each other. What is interesting is the actors. Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. Not two people you would tend to see in a movie together. I guess that's why it's called Longshot. I'm not sure I am interested.. One from earlier this year was Always Be My Maybe. About two people whose paths crossed over the years but they never got together as the timing was always wrong and their destinies took them different places. That one sounds more interesting.. Cool, one of my favorites this year was Murder Mystery with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler. The formula is the stale couple rekindling their romance but it takes place on a yacht and a murder takes place and they find themselves in the middle of trying to solve it while working out their relationship issues..

Haha, well it is, but there is a new one with Bruce Willis who is a surgeon in a hospital, his wife gets brutally attacked along with his daughter from a home invasion he becomes a vigilante, it's pretty good.. i may have seen something about that now that you mention that story hook.. or there is Mission Impossible Fallout, or Deadpool 2.... ive seen the first MI didnt like it that much, was good but not great. deadpool now thats a good one loved both. ive been wanting to watch once upon a deadpool also.. ok, great! I haven;t seen that one either.. bruce willis is great in just about everthing he's in as is ryan reynolds. both are great actors.. They are! I love them both too.

Yes, I love John Wick. have you seen John Wick 3?

JoJo Rabbit, an awsome film about childhoodlaughter in middle world war 2. i have seen the trailer it did look very onteresting. Well maybe it is but I would at least ask what genre your into. i like sci fi and really am into almost every genre. What Gemini Man starrrgin Will Smith?. loved that movie. i dont remember any other movie in the past with that story. Another that is icon, Avengers Endgame.. loved that movie too. i went three times to see it when it first came out. I was first confused when they switched the x men to the 70's. i agree that the whole prequel thing is getting old.. Star Wars next year is going into an boom with it's 5th sequel.. have you seen mandalorian?. I got tired of it, my headphones have to be replaced for my laptop. i am very excited for the next star wars. i think Disney ruined it at first but now i am starting to like them more and more.. One they favour the most is Venom.. that was also a good movie.. ", ". What's your favorite genre to watch lately?. i like pop music. Cheeky. the pop music feel like good. I'd recommend dancer in the dark then. It's a friendly musical starring Bjork.. are you recommend me. It's honestly not bad if you like Lars Von Trier movies.. i like the sci fi movies. How do you feel about Scarlett Johansson? Under the skin is a pretty eerie sci fi movie.. sounds is good. I'd say so.. yes i like to watch. Sounds like watching?. yes i like too. Scarjo gets nay nay.. its a web series on amazon. ", ". hi, how are you?. Hi, how are you? I'm curious to hear if you have a recommendation for a movie.. sure i have some movies to recommend for you. I just need to know your preferences.. The last great movie I watched was Midsommar. I'm a huge fan of Alamo Drafthouse Movie Parties because often times the plots and themes seemingly have all been done before.. oh I see. do you like action or horror movies?. Truthfully I am a documentary fan. Just a splash of sci-fi or horror. Midsommar to be was more of a really unusual acid trip (lol!) than a horror IMO.. lol i can recommend some documentaries. what kind do you like to watch?. History. Pirates. Tales of the ocean/boating/island life.. ok. i have a movie to recommend. how about pirates of the carribbean.. I've seen all of those and the one with Keith Richards was my favorite.. ok. do you want me to recommend that or something else.. I'm comfortable with that recommendation as I haven't watched those in several years and it would be fun to re-visit them.. ok. i will recommend one of those movies. how is pirates of the carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl. That's great. Thank you!. your welcome i just recommended it.. Is there any other similar movie you can think of off the top of your head?.

Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world.. and her voice?! Holy crap.

Did you see Birdbox? I thought it was pretty well done as well even though it was a similar concept.. I have but i was truly disappointed in the ending. totally.

I do sometimes like action but war movies where the main character dies make me mad. I am willing to hear your thoughts though.. I agree.

I will definitely watch it soon then. Tarantino's movies are the best. Excellent. Enjoy! Good chatting with you.. good bye. I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view. I will try to view them. buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot. They occasionally do. From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover. There are enough other twists hidden in the movie.. my favorite movie of will smith is Men in black. but he also does serious movies also.. This will in line with his normal level of acting.

So what sort of movies are you into? What sort of trailers do you like?. Well, since it is the holiday season I love watching Christmas movies. I know the ones on Netflix are not considered good movies but they are fun and I enjoy laughing at and with them.. Hm, there's a few new ones for this year that look like they might be funny. Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable! There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny!. Oh I don't know if I heard of that one? What is it about? I watched Klaus the other day and it was actually really good like I can see it becoming a Christmas classic.. It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually. Or is supposed to, if he was good at it! So I think it will have a lot of silly moments.. Oh that definetely seems like something I would enjoy! Thanks for the recommendation - I accept it! Sounds kinda similar to what I watched last night, which was about Santa's daughter and how she wanted to go to college and not take over the family business.. That sounds funny too! I hope you enjoy it! Getting into the Christmas spirit!. Yes I am!. I have another suggestion from, an older one that is just as silly as the newer one, called Bad Santa, have you seen that one?. I have not seen that one. It's a decent one, wacky adventures, a guy pretending to be santa and all the things that go with that. It's not as wholesome, but sometimes that's what makes it fun.. hmmm I will consider it, could be funny but I think I do prefer wholesome.. Hm, alright, what about Christmas Angel. Hmm I think I saw the trailer to that and it seemed too cheesy or bad acting. ", ". ", ". Hey, How are you today?. I'm doing great. How are you?. Good! Can't complain. I'm heading to a haunted house today with my kids. Their first time, do you like haunted houses?. Yes I think they are exciting, but if they are super horrifying then I don't care for them too much!. What kind of movie trailers do you like? Scary or do you have kids and need to go see Frozen 2. Scary movies are okay, but definitely not my favorite. I would much rather watch a thriller\\mystery\\crime movie.. Ah. Like Joker? Have you seen it yet? I loved it!. No I have not. What is it about? Who plays the Joker?. Joaquin Phoenix...It has Robert Denior in it too. Its great! One of my favorite Batman movies. You should really go see it.. I think I will. Could you send me to the movie trailer so that I can make sure its my kind of movie before I actually go see it?. Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t433PEQGErc. Thats perfect for me! Great recommendation. heres another one for joker. Thats awesome. Do you think you will go watch it?. I'm sure that I will!. Are you a big fan of Todd Phillips films?. I'm not sure, probably haha.

I could also recommend baby driver for a more guns and shooting style movie with cars. Its classic bank robbery, but focused on the getaway driver. Is it like Bonnie and Clyde?.

That is a really good sequel to the first. No, I haven't heard of that movie. Is it an action movie?. yes. Keanu Reeves from the Matrix is the star. I highly recommend the first John Wick if you haven't seen it. He's an assassin who just retired, but is forced back into the lifestyle for some sweet revenge. Its probably one of the best action movies of the decade. I really do like Keanu Reeves. I do like this type of action movie also. I like anything like NCIS, FB. Then you also might like SEVEN.

First part was very slow, second part was very intense. I didn't like how they ended the movie. I expect more from an oscar movie. I haven't seen it, But I heard it was a comedy/drama.

The 2 minute trailer for it on YouTube is also very exciting.. I have not seen that one. I will have to check it out. thank you. have you seen the movie what dreams may come? my son and I were actually talking about it yesterday. its a movie from 1998 but the graphics are very vibrant and rich. The concept of the movie is very unique which is something that I enjoy. I get tired of watching movies that have the same concepts but with different actors.. I've heard of that movie, with Robin Williams. I have it on my list of movies I want to see. Your husband will enjoy Sully. It's a movie you can watch parts of over and over, because of the tension and drama of landing the plane.. I will check out the trailer for the movie. Do you have any other recommendations? I worry about the movie being about landing a plane only because my husband was in the military and has some ptsd so I have to be careful with what we watch.

I guess recently I've been trying to find a good horror movie, but haven't had much luck.. Gotcha. What was the last horror movie you saw? What'd you think of it?. Last one was this cheap found footage movie called Helll house LLC. Defintely exceeded my expectations, especially with the budget constraints.. Oh nice! I saw a lot of people buzzing about that one since it's been on Amazon Prime. Found footage is hard to do well, I'm glad this one was good. Did you see Get Out or Us at all?

Very good choices that you have. Inception is a great movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor. Ya i agree. I also like the Girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy. I like the original swedish version though a bit better than the American version.. So you like foreign movies as well. I seem to think they offer a bit of a twist and turns in their movies. I am always on edge. Yes I like foreign films if they are well done, I also like Amelie, which is a French film I believe. How about the movie The Girl in the Spiders Web, that might be of interest to you. Yes I have seen bits and pieces of it which I liked, but never managed to catch it on TV the whole way through... That may be your movie to see. I hope you enjoy it. Yes. Thank you!. I hope you enjoy the trailer. Do you have any comedy recommendations? I like Superbad and Knocked up.. A low down dirty shame would be awesome to watch. Okay. I have never heard of that. I also need some info on action movies. I like Die Hard 1 and 2..

Maybe it wasn't advertised as widely as it should have been. The leading guy, who's adorable, probably isn't considered a big box office draw, like Brad Pitt. It seemed to be more of an independent little art-house type romantic comedy, if that makes sense. Now I want to re-watch it! Did the movie make you tear up?. It totally made me tear up!

Darn I haven't seen that one. Hmm, let me think unpredictable action comedy.... I also saw Snowpiercer the day before and liked it a lot - more than Parasite.. Yea, Snowpiercer had some real speed to it. Though both it and Parasite had very pretty cinematography.

It depends on how I'm feeling in the moment but I usually go for more light hearted films that are easy to digest..

That makes me want to learn more about it. I'll definitely look more into it and watch the trailers, etc. I accept your recommendation :).. Great! I hope you enjoy it. Nice chatting.. Are there any actors I would recognize in The Host?. Kang-ho Song the father from Parasite also in Snowpiercer is in the movie.. That's great! I love his acting.

Oh, I definitely wouldn't be opposed to that. What's the plot like?. You're got oldies but goodies like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Harrison Ford added to a huge team to take down a rival co-founder.. That seems like a great movie to watch with the kids.

Well my husband isn't a fan of any sappy movies. He likes action/suspense movies. So maybe something along the lines would be great?. ", ". ", ". Hello, Can I help you find a movie?. sure, I want a new release that is a comedy or a drama. Great! What kinds of movies did you like in the past? Any particular drama you watched and liked recently?. I like something mysterious with a bit of love. What do you mean by mysterious?. kidnapping, killing, emotional drama. OK, sounds good. any recommendations?. Do you like Ed Norton movies? He just had Motherless Brooklyn that was nominated for Oscar. It has some thrill to it and a very moving romantic sub-plot, as well as some interesting psychological aspects to it (the main character has a unique condition). sounds good. So, yes, I recommend you try Motherless Brooklyn -- it seems to have all the things you are looking for (drama, a bit of love, and for sure a lot of mystery) and it was positively critically acclaimed. thanks for the recommendation. There are other movies with Ed Norton if you like him. My favorite is The Illusionist. Love plays a bigger role there and it has elements of a period drama with mystery as well.. that sounds interesting. Now, what comedies did you like?. I likes There is something about Mary and Duece Bigelow, Male Gigolo. so you like more sexy stuff, I suppose?. I got that right. "], "un_mask_retrieved_resp": ["1917 would be perfect then!

Know of any movies that fit into these genres?. Actually, yes! I know lots of movies with this criteria. Give me an example of your favorite movie that meets these requirements.. Fast and Furious Movies, 300, 13 Hours: Soldiers of Benghazi, John Wick, etc. Okay, that gives me a good idea of what you are looking for. John Wick was a great movie. Now if you could tell me an example of a movie that you didn't like or care for?. I really didn't care for Blade Runner, it was too dull.

I really think it's up your alley.. I have not heard of it, what is it about?. First of all it has Vin Diesel... he plays a soldier and something happens to him.... I'm intrigued, are the ratings good?. I'm going to say it looks good. It gets released in February. I'm not sure if your looking for a future movie or one that is already out.. I've always got an eye out for good movies coming up. I would love to watch the trailer..
